	phone	review
1	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	very ordinary phone for daily use and if you are having having thoughts of buying a secondary phone just for calling then just go blindly and purchase it pros 1 battery life more then expected after using smartphone we are addicted to charge our phones for atleast once in a day not for this there is no need to charge it for atleast 2 days 2 look copy of lumia to give you the feel of it 3 sar value is very low when compared to other basic phones 4 multiple alarms 5 bright colorful themes 6 the dialed button has the option for all the recent dialed received and missed this feature is not present in most of previous nokia basic model phones 7 and most importantly 34rapid rolling34 baby oh yeah 8 pro for me as vibration is very much high and much needed if you are travelling and spend most of the hours outside 9 and 35 mm jack for the radio  and sadly cons 1 very small screen 2 not much of ringtone selection
2	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	this rating for vendor please blacklist this vendor i would love shop on amazon as there customer support is outstanding
3	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	an inexpensive phone which looks cheap but gives you what a phone is intended to and nothing else major pros 1no stress of loosing your phone be it by theft or breakage 2no bugs viruses screen issues or functionality issues it does not have much functionality to attract issues   3if it falls down  just pick it up fix the battery close the lid  and you are back in business and you dont miss a heartbeat which you would if it were a 25k smartphone minor pros 1phone calling and receiving  with ok volume of sound 2basic messaging 3torch for night reading 4wakeup alarm minor con 1you have to keep it hidden for all else most of which are redundant smartphone features  i have a laptop  which is open and connected in front of me in office and home 16 hrs a day rest of the time i sleep
4	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	no doubt product is value for money also i followed one trick got in review of amazon to get 30 off it works for me but got 25 off let it be just add 34taggetoff062134 at the end of link and use that link complete your formalities tadddaaaaaa discount will deducted in final price d d happy sometimes it dont work but doesnt matter xd this trick is working on most of amazon indias product give a try d enjoy eshopping happy d xd was this review helpful to you click 34yes34 so that the review come forward to all viewers and others also will get benefits of it 
5	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	literally i bought this phone only to make calls from my secondary sim card which is a lot cheaper compared to my primary sim and this smart little basic phone really provides me a lot of talktime the battery strength of this phone is  quite awesome when compared to my smartphone i make pretty much calls during the day and its battery status would have only two bars gone from the whole i havent tested the standby strength of this gadget as i am always using it though i think it will last really long as making so many calls a day leaves me so much battery behind the call quality  is good and is a good companion to make calls 24 hours a day the keypad of this phone is made of durable material and is dust and water proof obviously the phone is not  the body is made of durable plastic but attracts lots of scratches with daily use this phone is not good for hardcore texting because most of the group texts that i sent had failed and the phone shows hitches when sending quick texts  all in all this phone is really good for making calls listening to radio light texting mini gaming and playing with fingers
6	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	because of its durability this phone has basic feature required for a normal user very nice one at this price
7	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	was looking for such phone rocksolid sturdy phone especially my kid can now play with the original phone and not dummy one 
8	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	my mistake i went by the name nokia and thought it to be a decent product the phone is a complete waste of money the problems with the phone and amazon services are as below 1 the phone call quality is pathetic person at the other end is never able to figure out what i am talking in the first go 2 phone does not come with earphones 3 whatever is suppose to be there in the box is not there i think somebody must have tempered with the box 4 delivery boy who was sent to deliver the product was very rude and completely informal  amazon has to seriously look for having a quality check before they dispatch any product otherwise its gonna loose huge chunk of customer base
9	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	total waste of money i bought this as a standby fone thinking nokia is a brand and has been building sturdy rugged phones for quite a long time but this phone has changed my perspective  as per the price you cant expect much but at least decent quality is expected from this brand  mammoth battery life  problems i faced with this phone the vibrator is louder than the ringtone the whole housing gives a weird loud sound i get a distracting feedback echo of my voice loud and clear while talking which is the worst problem ive ever faced i can hardly hear the person i am talking to  i would rather give a treat to my friends than buy this crap
10	Nokia 105 (Black Color)	a very bare basic phone that does the job it is assigned to do make calls type messages and you are using this phone to the maximum voice quality is at acceptable levels so is the ringer quality the led torch is almost nonexistent and there are no other features in this phone to write about

48	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	good basic phone with big and clear display good for older persons sms can be stored only in phone memory  100 or 200 sms then you have to delete the older sms for new sms and the reading message text colour is light blue and the background is white that sometimes may be strain to read good battery backup and clear sound
49	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	as always a nokia does moot disappoint like with a mcdonald burger anywhere in the world tasting the same so is it with nokia phones  reliability it serves the purpose well there is one flaw however the screen is not bright enough to counter indias sunlit outdoor environment outside in the sun the display is hard to read

53	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	nice phone for those who want a basic phone with just a little twist of multimedia features but this phone lacks few things like the shortcuts should have been customisable and this phone is a bit slippery but overall o liked the battery backup of the device while on standby
54	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	it was a good product but i had ordered both white phones but delivered 1 white and 1 black this was fine with me however next time the product must be checked to meet the requirements with the customer before sending it anyway the product was worth the money
55	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	the phone looks nice and meets the requirement at the given price point
56	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	perfect mobile for my mom as she need big and bright screen for display  also comes with gujrati language plus point for that slim profile makes it look more expensive then what it is loud enough for elderly people
57	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	i like the product good for my elderly wife not so gadgetsavvy
58	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	i bought this phone for my motherbright red and for my wife black  i bought different coloured phones fearing that they might misplace their phones colour wise bright red is awesome with a sturdy keypad and a smooth finish the black one was good too except that unlike the bright red one the keypad was a bit wobbly i first thought that it was damaged then discovered that it was the same in all black phones here are the pros and cons  pros ¶ best display ever for a phone under 3000 ¶ the user interface is very good  ¶ screen is quite big and keypad is nice too ¶ the 2mp camera can be used to its fullest potential ¶ it has a very useful flashlight ¶ it has fb and twitter pre installed  cons 8710 very very less internal memory 8710 no 3g  after reading this i guess u will prefer this phone
59	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	i presented this phone for my grandfather guess wat  he loves it the phone is handy and beautiful everything is as expected but the flash light is a bummer    the camera and audio is great  easy ui d
60	Nokia 225 (Dual SIM, Black)	i bought this phone for my father he is satisfied and excited to use this phone the set up on this phone is pretty basic and the look is sleek and we also have memory card option so thats cool so far so good
61	Samsung Guru GT-E1200 (Indigo Blue)	this phone is hassle free charge it over the weekend and use it all week just basic features useful for older people who need to just make and receive callssms for 60 1000 i think this is the best branded phone
62	Samsung Guru GT-E1200 (Indigo Blue)	its been 1 year since i was gifted this mobile and even today it is new i have the white one but it never gets dirty coz oil or any material you just wipe out and its clean and new as beforeregarding battery life you have to charge it once a week only even if you talk 30 mins every day thats amazing for lazy people like me who hates recharging from time to timeand even when its 1 bar only in battery it lasts for 2 days signal and coverage is good voice quality is good  make sure u r not standing under a water tank though its just the best mobile for those who use touch screen mobiles and hate low battery life its light weight and compact
63	Samsung Guru GT-E1200 (Indigo Blue)	the product is good but the headphone jack is primitive and headphones are supposed to fit into same slot as charger cablenot the standard 35mm type the product comes without headphones and finding the right accessories is a problem i have not found headphones for this yet  any help would be appreciated
64	Samsung Guru GT-E1200 (Indigo Blue)	this phone is meant only for those people who follow the policy of bare minimum is enough  less is more and never believe in upgrading to the latest smart phones for the sake of fashion trends or their life style being vedantistsi belong to this category as this is my 3rd basic phone since 2002i had already used a samsung guru duos gt e1207 dual sim since feb 2015 and so knew all that this phone has and does not have i bought this as a gift for my mother aged over 68 yrs as she like myself never believed in complications a person who is just now adopting gsm technology in hisher life would love this phone  features  it has a plain single gsm normalmini sim slot  no micro sd card support  no camera  no bluetooth  no music player  no video playerrecorder no image viewer no fm radio no frills no earphones  pros the purpose of this phone is just to keep it in standby mode to make and receive calls sendreceive sms netbanking otps for which it does the work without fuss call clarity is crystal clear even with 3rd rate mtnl gsm network inside the room full 6 bars signal available always the phone is very good in picking up even faint signals it has many useful features like metric converterstop watch calculator timer world clock torch light and has battery saver mode if this is enabled then battery can last easily for 15 days in standby and 10 days in mixed use  cons no internal battery to keep the clock and date fixed even after main battery is removed no auto power shut off  switch on feature
65	Samsung Guru GT-E1200 (Indigo Blue)	good buy value for money some simple extra features like fm radio would make this more popular  jpb 224  
66	Samsung Guru GT-E1200 (Indigo Blue)	product is much better than what i expected pros  no memory card slot and camera i was looking n hoping for without these two features due to my work place requirement  keypad finish and display are nice and not glaring as other basic phones do  colour display and handset colour white are too good for a match  cons none have used 3 basic phones of samsung make they are great and battery talktime and life are unmatched even by nokia

81	Nokia 215 (Dual SIM, Black)	nokia 215 is pretty nice as a backup phone with battery life of weeks the build quality is great with smooth edges the key pad is perfectly spaced which ensures accurate click for eldersand it is backlit too about call quality not the best in call quality but is decent for the priceits not that clear but still its ok charger is universal type with micro usb and microsoft branding earphones are the usual nokia ones but this time with microsoft branding the 03 is camera is probably the basic ones it supports internet and is bundled with opera mini fb and more but no whatsappand as of i checked you cant install whatsapp in it there is also a memory card slot too which works well a expected it only supports 2g the 24 inch display is bright and viewable its light weight conclusionvalue for money as a 24 incherbest suited for elders and as secondary phone
82	Nokia 215 (Dual SIM, Black)	bought this from amazon for rs 2069 here is my detailed review pros light weight optimum screen size backlit keys nice call quality and volume is good enough cons screen quality is very low causing strain to your eyes although the numeric keys are widely spaced the main navigation key is too small and it is difficult to use especially if you dont have long nails it is main disadvantage i found in this phone optimizing the home screen is not possible so you have to go to the menu to open a certain task which will be difficult to elders overall i would recommend this phone to use as a secondary phone or someone who uses the phone for just calling putposes and i know there is no need to write about the camera quality games and other applications because there are lot of other phones in market which are meant for the same

105	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Black)	i got impressed with the photos of this phone and gave order but when the product came i was surprised it looks like a cheap chinese phone it was very difficult to remove the back cover i had to spend 45 minutes to remove it dont know why they designed the back cover like this the phone feels like cheap doesnt look like this is made by nokia or microsoft and the worst part is the display it is very poor the only thing is that it is colour display it is ok if this phone costs around 1800rs but costing 2800rs this is bull shit we hate the display every time we look at it no comments about the camera quality but im sure my 8 year old samsung x700 with 16mp camera is 100 times better than this phone yes it is a great buy if yoy get it for 1800rs but for 2800rs this is a big no dont buy this
106	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Black)	was eager to buy this everything looks ok but battery backup not so good for a nokia costumer his expectation for a battery backup will be always high that not meets the expectation and rest features are good
107	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Black)	product is good but little problem in music player as u cannot resume ur songs after when call comes to ur mobilealso for selecting ur songs from memory cardthe song will not be played to next song
108	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Black)	this is an excellent pieceit runs perfectlyits camerasound quality and other features are amazingi a completely satisfied with this mobile phonei suggest the genuine online buyers who are serious about quality and value for money may opt this productits battery life is manageable it lasts for three days once recharged in normal callingreceiving situation and five to six days without calling or receiving cases overall this is a good product of nokia
109	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Black)	ordered for a black got a white one did not blaming the seller as the pack is sealed even the nokia label mentioned the colour as black and got imei nos inside the phone correct seems like some mistake made by the manufacturer as its the budget feature phone no complaints  love the regional language options as she is comfortable reading on local languages than english for using the mobile
110	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Black)	good phone  good ones are 1 easy to use 2 handy enough 3 simple functions 4 camera 2mpis good 5 bright colours with good styling 6 extra ordinary feature of torch light  bad ones are 1 no themes facility 2 cannot rearrange icons 3 no sync with nokia pc suit ovi suit 4 no whatsapp messenger app 5 no equalizer in music player 6 no ovi store application  verdict nokia 220 is a basic mobile handset with good styling and design but it truly missing nokias basic functions and interface if you need a basic stylish handset with dual sim facility 2mp camera  radio this is it
111	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Black)	the phone is good in most of the aspects but it lacks a very basis featureto store more than one number against one contact that is it allows to store only 1 number against 1 contact nowadays people have multiple numbers hence was expecting this feature to be available in fact i found that this feature is not available in most of nokia phones with symbian os now

115	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Black)	the product quality is very poor the battery back up become very poor after 23 months i have to charge every day even if i am not using the phone for any calling after 4 months phone started showing some problems with display very bad experience from amazon india

117	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Black)	an excellent budget phone    the 2mp camera also delivers good quality images the battery back up is also good    if you are looking for a good basic phone and if u dont care much about how it looks then definitely go for it

294	Nokia 220 (Dual SIM, Red)	this is a decent handset i bought this for my father but this does not completely serve the purpose both the loudspeaker  ringer as well as the phone speaker volumes are pretty low and hard to hear for somebody whose hearing is not as good as it once was also positioning of the loudspeaker is such that the sound often comes muffled when the phone is not on a hard reflective surface eg on the bed  overall ok phone but do not buy if you are buying it for an older person or somebody who is a little hard of hearing

452	Binatone The Brick Mobile Phone	phone model the brick power  excellent product fit and finish is top notch for those are who are curious about the  charging stand whether provided or not   yes  they do provide the charging stand as shown in the picture and phone charges when kept in the stand the phone can be charged without the stand also battery is 2000 mah so sure it will last for ages  fm radio and audio player pretty good sound quality during calls is decent keypad is backlit this helps a lot torch is provided single button onoff though rather weak  phone looks beautiful very light weight and easy to carry and if you carry it in public places people will gather around you yesterday i did try this people started asking me are you a defence  cid person   this could be because they might have thought this brick as a satellite phone  fun apart this phone has many usages especially while travelling  trekking thanks to its robustness extra large battery and this can act as a power bank too  means this can charge your other smart phone  if you have senior citizens at home then this is a must buy  what else one could ask for just rs 2260   highly recommended

489	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	have been using this phone since 27feb2015 found it excellent  no complaints with call clarity signal intensity or faced any software laggs as compared to a nokia 130 dual sim this is better battery life with 24 hrs on in dual sim standby mode with nil fm radio usage and some calls madercvd is one charge reduced in 4 days from full only 3 wall papers given which can be customized with each sim same with ringtone and sms tune the 2 negative feature which i found was one has to select the sim from which one has to make calls using  key 1st and then dial the phone after dialing the no does not ask u to choose the sim like nokia 130 dual sim for example mtnl sim will used for mtnlbsnl calls  vodafone sim for private operator calls also the phone does not have a auto power switch onoff feature where it will switch on automatically in the morning and switch off at night  if one is sufficient with basic things in life and follows the policy of less is more then this is the best dual sim phone in the market to make and receive calls and send text sms many other useful features like metric converter stop watch world clock calculator torch and battery save mode given
490	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	depends on what you are looking for it is the device for you if all you are looking for is making calls occasional smss something you can put in your pocket and forget for the rest of the day i charge it every third day the battery has never ran out on me in additional features well it has got fm
491	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	this product is very good this panal is very strong and nicely we can also use this some products like it 
492	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	nothing is upto the mark definitely not the value for money  not worth buying it dual sim is little relief thanks
493	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	this product is lacking in software to connect with pc samsung co does not provide any software for to and fro transfer of phone directory with pc  the work of transferring phone book directory from other mobile to this mobile through pc is not possible and hence this process becomes a time killing process
494	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	the handset is just a basic phone can be only used for calling messaging through this phone seems a pain in the a just use it as you never bother about it cheapest dual sim phone
495	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	product was good packing is also bery good but thr price of product is hiher than its mrp 1450 was written on the mobile box  it should be priced atlesat 1300
496	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	amazon is best  and this phone is best for those who want dual sim basic phonebattery is exceptionallight weight phonego for it 
497	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	was using it for the last 23 years  now purchased another for a family member  a very good mobile phone worth for its cost
498	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	very good battery backup easy to use recommended for business users or for people who want good battery life
499	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	a really good phone by samsung but in this price some other brands give some more features in basic phones
500	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	1 robust one 2 easy to carry 3 sometimes it hangs up 4 buy if u have no other option
501	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	nice mobile and for budget mobiles it is very good among them it is working good
502	Samsung Guru E1207T (Black)	decent phone with basic features at this pricepoint i am a happy customer

509	Nokia 130 (Dual SIM, White)	this is hands down the best mobile phone i have ever owned in my life  over the past 3 years i have owned about 20 low and midrange android phones from various brands samsung lenovo mmx sony htc android phones always have their frustrations mainly because they are 34preloaded34 with a boatload of useless software and because of androids stupid design you cannot get rid of that bloatware if you cannot root your phone add to that the fact that 3g never works in india at least for me in fact i broke most of my phones out of pure rage with nonworking 3g connections or some unwanted bloatware starting up unexpectedlysuddenly and doing unexpected 34bloatwarely34 things  in the 34simplephone34 category i have owned quite a few nokia phones  but frankly i had always hated them nokia was also in the habit of loading its phones with useless crapware and most of the nokia phone designs were pathetic  so when i was looking for a simple easy to use phone with discrete buttons for my mom i happened to find this i bought the first piece for myself and a second piece for my mom within moments of getting my phone i fell in love with it it is lightweight it is small but handy theres no useless software on this phone theres no 34internet34 access on this phone this is just what a mobile phone should be in india a way to makereceive calls a way to receive textmessage updates from your friends and banks and a way to send an occasional text message if you need other things like internet access internetweb based messaging social networking etc in our 3rd world country then you better have access to a high speed connection and a tablet  so this phone has all the features i would want from a simple phone in fact this has become my primary phone all of my still surviving android phones have become 34tablets34 that connect to some wifi network i am off 3g for now and hopefully for ever
510	Nokia 130 (Dual SIM, White)	purchased it on 09feb2015 have used it for 2 months listed are the pros  cons   cons 1no file managerbrowser option like chinese gsm phones 2no image viewer and background wallpaper change via micro sd card 3no internal battery so each time the clock has to be reset if the battery is removed 4battery has to be removed every time one changesremoves sim  micro sd card  pros 1excellent build quality made in vietnam 2excellent call quality phone will accept only normal gsm mini sims not micro sims so no backward compatibility with smart phones 3fm radio and micro sd card work even without sim cards which is very good 4upon auto scan fm radio scanned and saved all fm channels in ncr region with their names also 5fm radio needs headphonesin the box normal 35mm to be plugged or else it will not work even in background 6music player automatically detects the mp3 files in sd card and makes a listsound quality is very very goody from the mp3 files detected one can customize  set ring  sms tones of both sim cards individually this feature is the most important as built in tones are archaic 7same with the video player the video player scans and makes a list of all video files  plays only mp4mpeg4  avi files even heavy movie files of 500mb but once the video starts there is no way to jump the video forward or backward and play from where one wants only pause and stop and then it starts from the beginning 8the phone easily detected a 32 gb sandisk micro sd card 9no camera which is a relief for people like me 10battery can easily play 3 movies of 150 hrs with half charge remaining from zero to full battery takes 3 hours to charge 11bluetooth is very fast and can receive 20mb files in 6210 minutes 12if connected to the pc via a micro usb cablenot in the box sd card gets detected in no time and files can be transferred effortlessly and phone can also be charged via the usb 13has other useful features like torchschedulercalculatoralarm but no scheduler for auto power onoff for the phone  verdict  for whom this phone is meant   so for those people who like a slim easy to carry phone in pocket with maximum battery life  who do not expect much from things and follow the policy of lessbare minimum is enough peace of mind factor of spares and after sales servicegood build quality nokia 130 is a very good buy  only minuses are a lack of image viewer  background wallpaper customization which is available in a rs 500 richmax svelte 15 chinese phone also my view is that if mp3  mp4 files are regularly played the battery will be dead in 6 months as the bl5c battery is not meant for such heavy usage if mp3  mp4 playing is ones concern buy a better handset with higher mah battery like chinese models

624	Micromax Rockstar C192 (Black)	keypad is very bad eg  when you press buttons it makes press noises but wont work you may need to press hard for it to work some times it works smoothly  i purchased mainly to make calls but after receiving i found that headset pin is mini usb and mono that is headset have only one ear piece and i tried searching mini usb headsets online to purchase but didnt find any so if the headset comes with the mobile go faulty i dont know how to get a new headset sound clarity via phone headphone and phone ear piece is good and louder its clear other person also receives our sound in clarity  so purchase only if  you need an additional mobile cdma one  to make calls because you get very low tariff on cdma remember  headset if go faulty you may not get similar one  dont gift phone to old people  because keypad wont work smoothly so theyll feel extreme difficult to use

734	Lava ARC 22 Beats (White)	a very good basic phone at budget price the sound  clarity is too good and the key pad is also good i bought it for my home nice make over and design  as far as negatives are concerned the caller button will not show dialled calls list rather it will  ask to select one of options from missed dialled all incoming as far as amazons delivery is concerned  i became fan of amazonbecause i have ordered it on sunday and got it my monday afternoonamazon keep rocking guys0
735	Lava ARC 22 Beats (White)	phone is damn good in looking sound is good but operating the mobile is little bit difficult call history is changed i mean it is showing separately for missed calls received and dialed calls it has become a problem for elders who are illiterate so i used the shortcuts camera quality is okay headsets were pathetic very less sound when plugged in with it but working fine with other headsets overall phone is good but you have to learn how to operate it
736	Lava ARC 22 Beats (White)	sound is very lowdidnt expect it from lava

750	iBall Aasaan 2 White	a second edition has to be a significant improvement over the first edition  that is general verve this model fails this assumption it is an improvement only in some aspects from iball aasaan1 and a downgrade in some aspects  my father used asaan 1 for over four years and the phone stopped charging recently stating  bad contact of charger the iball service centre could not repair the phone i wanted a repair as this is the phone my father was used to so like all enthusiastic unwise youngster i bought iball asaan 2 thinking that it would be similar in use and better than iball asaan 1 i also bought a philips xenium for a comparison  i ball asaan 1 recited the number of the number key pressed  you press 1 and the speaker says one this way the visually impaired can know the key they have pressed iball asaan 1 also recited the time on the hour these two features are absent in asasaan 2  asaan 2 has a much longer battery life and a display that is better visible in daylight  as compared to asaan 1 the speaker of asaan 2 is very bad the sound cracks much inferior to asaan 1 asaan2 has a brighter torch than asaan 1 the camera and dual sim on asaan 2 are neither good nor necessary asaan1 has a tedious message and text entry asaan 2 is an improvement over it  my father could not get used to the phone and i have just bought another asaan1  my take if you are buying the phone for a senior citizen go for philips xenium  i find it much better bigger display smoother software brighter torch good  well lit and distinct keys great battery life the phone is larger though if the user is already used to asaan 1 go for an asaan1 till stocks last again as migration to asaan 2 may not be easy and asaan 2 has many weakpoints  this is my wisdom after buying three phones to settle on one 
751	iBall Aasaan 2 White	mobile phone features are good 1 screen size is small to read the message one need to use down arrow key to read the whole of the message and for senior citizens this is what poses challenges and is troublesome 2 guiding light on keypad for 2 number key is absent
752	iBall Aasaan 2 White	that was the whole purpose to bring this product to market and after the previous phone went out of order due to my sons constant engagement my mom asked to buy the same one again i did not review the features but within two years the same phone has changed so much in same price dual sim fm torch camera etc  a good buy for sure
753	iBall Aasaan 2 White	puchased for my father 80 years  he is using it comfortably numbers are written in big fonts and clearly which is very helpful for him
754	iBall Aasaan 2 White	already using an earlier version of the phone so not disappointed with product that was delivered apt for senior citizens entire process from booking to delivery of product was smooth and efficient
755	iBall Aasaan 2 White	it was waste deal its incoming voice very poor during the call i cant hear the incoming voice on call i purchased it for my 80 years fathar but he didnt like it please replace it
756	iBall Aasaan 2 White	i gifted this to my aged momvery nice and  emergency feature is very so good and so many languages options
757	iBall Aasaan 2 White	good mobile for senior citizens with sos facility the battery comes as per the promise made
758	iBall Aasaan 2 White	great for the elderly it was delivered on time
759	iBall Aasaan 2 White	good product screen could have been made bigger

817	Karbonn K105s (Black + Red)	it is better to stop this product which may prevent the company from loss of so much of money as many basic needs of a mobile are not met here are my experiences 1without turning on speaker voice is not audible neither the other end user can here my voice which is total nonsense when you are in public place 2when i turn on loudspeaker it takes 3 seconds to turn on 3when i want to cut the calli will have to press the cancel button minimum 4 times which is a bulls 4dictionary option is not present for message typing 5money spent by company on camera with that low pixel quality is a pure waste as nobody cares about it and everyone prefers 5mp  here are my suggestions for karbonn company to improve the quality of product ans avoid unnecessary expenses which are total pointless  1avoid camera in this set 2improve basic qualities like calling without turning on loudspeakerdictionary in message typing 3torch  dual sim memory card system are good options to continue though i havent used 2 sims  memory card slot and earphones  although you add extra features to attract customers in a basic setthey become waste when basic functioning is not met  anybody would prefer any basic nokia set than this

1085	Gionee L700 (Black)	gionee l700 is really a good buy because  1 product is wellbuilt  robust 2 bright display 3 good battery backup 4 in the given price offers many features l 5 led torch provided is very bright  very handy for use 6 overall a nice basic phone with full of features
1086	Gionee L700 (Black)	bought this product almost a month ago all is well until it fell down from pocket from a  2 feet high into not so hard floor after which display gradually became black apparently no warranty coverage and service center quotes around 800 to change the display also we need to wait for the part to come  i never expected the mobile to become unusable for a small fall like this my previous phone nokia had many similar and worst falls than this and was very sturdy gionee has a long way to go in getting the quality  good bye gionee  no more of your products
1087	Gionee L700 (Black)	compared to the price range its well and good also gives competition to other android same range product those who wants their phone for rough use it is not suitable for that go for nokia
1088	Gionee L700 (Black)	this mobile has long battery life 1700mah it gives battery backup upto 7 daysits sound quality best and it has inbuilt operaminifacebooktwitter  lots more games  apps but the browering speed is slow then other mobile
1089	Gionee L700 (Black)	running java apps but lite version apps running in it because of low memory good sound good camera under this range body design is attractive
1090	Gionee L700 (Black)	first of all amazon is amazingall thanks to the team for the wonderful customer supportregarding the product it s of average quality however much better than indian brandsbattery backup s good but call quality is bad
1091	Gionee L700 (Black)	the product is a bit costly however enough sturdy and battery back up is too excellent  almost 10 days  overall good product with higher price
1092	Gionee L700 (Black)	good phone with good battery life minimum 4 days  maximum 2 weeks  as per the product description it has 16mb internal memory storage but actually it has only 1mb internal memory storage so memory card is essential for capturing photostoring video  audio songs  that means it is a perfect phone if we use with minimum of 8gb sdcard
1093	Gionee L700 (Black)	low price but many options so i am very happy
1094	Gionee L700 (Black)	bought this for my mom and she liked it i would recommend checking out the s8 from gionee if youre interested in this one

1194	Panasonic GD21 (Silver)	value for money
1195	Karbonn KC540 (White)	firstly keeping in mind the price of this phone this is quite a nice choice compared to the other products with same or nearby specifications the voice reception is good and so are its looks with a  few limitations like only one number  recorded  against one name rest is good one thing should be noted by the manufacturing  company here karbonn that they declare their service centers at different places and then those people say that they provide service based on the marketing agents  for this i had to visit asansol 50 kmsaway from my home town durgapur  although karbonn declare to have service centre here at durgapur  713213   there too i was denied the service of replacement of my headphone that was faulty from the begining  finally amazon agreed to take back the handset for this and refund made which could have been agreed upon if they just had come to an understanding with me about the headset the customer service of amazonin is really very good  perfect and easily communicable they had delivered the product before time and for the unfortunate return took full responsibility of taking it back  wish amazon  be more careful about their scheduled sellers
1196	Karbonn KC540 (White)	good one strongly builtsoftware needs to be improved value for money  one of the better option for entry level cdma phones

1289	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	a decent product by nokia i got this product 3 days ago amazing design stylish looks software better than other asha series dual sim only con abt this is it supports micro sim and lastly good service by amazoni have checked on all the sites amazon providing the cheapest one of this product keep it up amazon
1290	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	i purchased this phone for my mom initially i was a bit hesitant thinking whether my mom will be able to use it or not to my surprise my mom feels more comfortable in using this phone the camera is superb i liked its color and the design the fastlane is awesomethanks nokia  amazonas usual superb
1291	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	there is wifi problem in phone as this is bug in software wen multiple wifi network is there its starting disconnecting nokia should do something about thhis to release some patch  rest is fine in phone
1292	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	its a good small budget phone but personally i am not finding its downloading option  when i download a song its not showing that whether it is downloaded or not the 2nd thing is that email files are not opening properlyjust source codes r opened but i will tell you its battery backup is good  small stylish differnet colours phone ie amazing
1293	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	it is an amazing phone for its price but i can tell that nokia has gone too far with trying to make it very fancy with the features they have incorporated the slide feature wherever possible it gets really irritating sometimes like in case of the alarm i just could figure out how to put the phone on snooze when the alarm woke me up  but overall it is an amazing phone and i would recommend this to any1 who is in search of a low budget phone
1294	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	bad cam quality no 32 mega pixel its like vga picture qualitysound is also not goodbad quality and wastage of money
1295	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	it my fst shopping online and i got good product and good services by amazonso i love my phone an ur amazon
1296	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	fantastic service by amazon product is good as expected from nokia good responsive screen  music  apps and all things
1297	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	it is nice and beautiful and working nicely for the present it is ok and happy to own this phone
1298	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	excellent mobile from nokia but sadly only to flaunt mobile doesnt have much feature  some apps need internet to start 
1299	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	pros very impressive build and design good internet connectivity reasonably priced features in top 5 smartphone of 2013 programme very good camera for pictures taken during daytime whatsapp added recently and facebook availability  cons has slow response problem at times onscreen keypad hangs at times works with micro sim only no 3g support no internet radio option
1300	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	loved the phone awesome color innovative ui slick phone takes very less space in my pocket a complete value for money buy
1301	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	its looks like nothing but a smart phonesimplebudget phoneby nokiai loved it if the same would worked with sim 1 alsoi returned it because of the failure of sim 1 slot not reading any of the sim cards i put intoso only this is the reason i returnedotherwise its a good bargain i would say
1302	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	this is a budject phone it means price between 4000 to 5000 touch work fast but windows operating is different from others
1303	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	the phone comes with trust of nokia and it fulfills the expectations but the worst part of the company is the introduction of micro sim feature it is really a headache and very very bad experience in installing and activating the sim as a slight misplacement in the slot results in no sim error rest all is just awesome about this phone d once done with placing the sim in slot i alert you not to shuffle it again u may end up banging your head in order to set the sim in its right coordinates d
1304	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	my mom loves it so do i  she is more than happy to see a touch phone completely in hindi language
1305	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	the asha series of touchphones are going to stay here for some time such is the range of features and the price  i have used mobiles from a number of companies but i have always found nokia to be the best value for money very few bells and whistles but the machines are easy to handle are intuitive and work well they are also strong and hardy   the machine has a sleek build  the touch screen is superb  very responsive  it is dualsim capable  it is wifi enabled  it has a good camera  it is highly intuitive  i would say that this is perhaps the best model that the asha series offers as of this date the slightly higher price compared to other models is more than compensated by the features that one gets in return
1306	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	the asha 501 is one of the best asha series phone because it comes with a highly durable body and some interesting features which were not available in the earlier models if you want to gift a phone to someone then you can go for this and also ensure that you check out the available color options because they are just beautiful and vibrant
1307	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	look is very good battery very very okfunction also okbut never buybecoz its priceit is just a baisic mobile with touch over priced and no internal memory
1308	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Yellow)	value for money spent people who need phone just for the purpose it serves 34 to communicate34 need not spend a bomb for the same this is a very neat phone
1309	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Bright Red)	nice looking and light weight full of apps and functionalities very good display but only drawback is its average battery backup need to charge every second day  i searched many sites for this but amazon offered lowest price  also 10 cashback amazon is really a reliable and best transport service provider
1310	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Bright Red)	the phone is really nice ideal for someone needing a good reliable phone with some smart features pros 1 build quality is awesome 2 very good design 3 wifi bluetooth slam 4 nice loud speaker 5 big screen fm radio 6 very very responsive capacitive touch screen 7 4 gb sd card included  cons 1 camera is not like 32 mp but considering the price its good overall a very good buy
1311	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Bright Red)	i bought this phone as a gift for someone whos not familiar or comfortable with the latest mobile technology but after using the phone a bit myself and teaching them how to use it im delighted with the nokia asha 501 its easy to use and has some good features at this price point the touch screen is very responsive and the interface is modern and intuitive to use the screen is a little low on resolution but wont complain about it for its price the build quality is typical nokia  feels like its built to last  what i will complain about is the headphone which is mono not stereo as it should have been also whatsapp is not yet available on this phone even though it is available for many other asha series phones line and wechat are available but they are not what everybody is using  on the whole i would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a good alternative to cheap slow low quality android phones  edit december 13 the phone now has whatsapp its a firmware update over the air ota this adds one more tick to the list of necessary features i wanted so im even happier now 
1312	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Bright Red)	i had ordered for a red piece but got a bright pink one  and it was for my mom  who absolutely did not like the colour the phone is good very efficient phone for the given price with many utilities packed into it

1318	Nokia Asha 501 (Dual SIM, Bright Red)	the phone is nice but have preferred a bigger screen and would have nice if it could have skype too

1344	Celkon C349* (Black-Red)	charger and mobile charging terminal does not work it didnt worked ever there is no proper support i need to check other parts after this review i got the immediate call from seller  informed about the case in fact within 2 days only he sent a new charger on his own expense but as the product was at default so he advised accordingly to return the product as getting involved in service center would be more painful he advised genuinely did his best to resolve the issue from his end for the seller i would rate 5 star and service from amazon as usual is amazing but should be careful with products as they can hamper their reputation

1364	Nokia 106 (Black)	this phone which i bought from a local seller which has less rate than amazon i bought this for using it as a basic phone since i am a fan of nokia 1100 which was rather good in its make and sound quality with that in mind i bought this basic phone and sadly to say this is one of the worst phone i have ever used i think recent low end karbon phones show much quality than this piece even the make and keypad can be negotiated but the sound quality which we require most for a basic phone this is an useless piece the problem of this phone is  it has sound leak google it ie it has  an opening in the back side which is  for loud speaker and you can hear from the backside also most sound is leaked through it also it affects privacy also it causes a lot sound of the air which is rushed through this hole when you are traveling  you have to push or press the headset towards the ear since the sound is leaked  so when selecting a basic phone which we need the most voice is one of the worst feature of this phone  so those who are buying this phone for calling purposes dont go for this it not worth a single penny  note when i checked the phones bought by my friends like 106 105 all have got this issue and i when i complained it to nokia they said you can get  only a replacement of the product since it is not repairable but when contacted the local seller he said this is not registered as a complaint he said this problem you are saying is default for the phone and could not be replaced anyway i lost my money since i havent bought the product from amazon please dont ignore this minimum google the issue you will find that i am saying the truth  thanks

1510	Panasonic GD22 (Black)	the software of the mobile is dated and u dont have one button dialit is also a king size mobile and may not suit everybodythe music volume is medium that r the cons  the pros the sound circuits r hi fidelity and music and voice calls are excellent the big size also means a big battery inside and big buttons its screen is luxurious and 1 megapixel camera is surprisingly good on the table it will dwarf other feature phones if u like big then this is the one at its price i would definitely recommend to a friend because of pedigree and built quality
1511	Panasonic GD22 (Black)	its sound is good have a large display screen only two good things i noticed  it copies nokias software but not user friendly as nokia its expandable memory is great but its software make this worthless it is slim but its length bc of large display screen make it unfit for pocket its back cover is of poor quality doesnt have holding capacity in pocket so it slips from pocket frequently i doubt whether  it is worth  34panasonic34 i expects much more in this name

1551	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	i love microsoft windows 81 operating system in mobiles as compare to android and i found this device lumia 535 perfectly great in this budget  i have gifted this to my family member if you have higher budget then lumia 730 is really great option having with me  all are perfect as expected  only camera does not have zoom facility in this model that really annoying  but that you can avoiding installing free camera 360 app from store
1552	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	lumia 535 a pretty decent phone its actually underrated the camera though 5mp shoots some real great stuffs the front facing 5mp camera well there is no need to talk about it its perfect better than most front facing cameras in market the inbuilt and expandable memory shipping with the snapdragon chipset and 1gb ram makes the phone the best product to buy below 10k and its a microsoft product so the phone life will be at least 3 years from now not like android of samsung or any other company no matter what android you but it lasts around max 2 years build quality is very good  and people talking about the touch problem yes agreed there is one problem the touch doesnt work properly sometimes but its a software problem currently the update that solves the problem is out so update the phone and the problem about zoom crazy stupid people they dont even know its not a problem its a feature if you double tap on the screen with two fingers the screen magnifies wherever in the phone you are it magnifies to turn this feature off just go to ease of access in settings and turn this feature off dumb people  its a phone worth buying trust me
1553	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	excellent product in a reasonable price no hanging problem i found it as i expected
1554	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	i got this phone when it was rs 8800  i saw the reviews before buying this  they said it had touch issues i wanted to try windows phone so i got it  yes it had issues  suddenly the phone wud zoom had to restart to make it alright mp3 songs wud just stop playing all of a sudden but i had this problem for the first 2 or 3 days after that no such issues its fine and the phone is superb   best phone for this rate by microsoft amazon delivery was amazing  saturday night ordered got it on sunday afternoon
1555	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	its nice phone by microsoft at low cost and has nice camera both primary and secondary
1556	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	not expected from microsoft that they can build this kind of a cheap quality product i researched more when have to buy this lumia 535  i know that there is a problem with touch issue can be resolved with an 81 update but trust me friends its not completely solved  touch pad is really fing when chatting adds more space between words some letters typed double n sometimes not typed even with hard touch touchpad feels like hard sometimes n sometimes more sensitive a blow can type a letter if u scroll an app will auto open like we double tapped specially when our hands are a bit wet  i thought microsoft dont know that the first impression is the last impression this is there first phone in market  about the os good  not many apps  but tiles good full hd videos cant be played cause its using 12 quadcore 200 series processor its not a carl zeiss optics on rare camera you can not share your internet connection with a usb cable to a pc andoids have the ability to share internet with usb only a wifi hotspot to connect final its not a regrettable choice of phone  may other new models of microsoft have better quality
1557	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	first things first i was not planning to shell a lot of money and sort of budget buyerthe price offered here at amazon is about atleast 2k lesser so thumbs up and thank you for thatoh and the delivery was within 48 hours  now talking about the experience with phone first impressionrichlightgreat ui to use cameravideo recordingcamera is greatnoteno high quality ie 720p recording  go for lumia 540 for even better camera facilitiespreety much everything usual with some extra bit of claimed security from microsoft and added features usabilitytouch is smoothcan get familiar with the os and phone overall within couple of hours those who are concerned about not wanting to use windows store over play storedo not get upset there are lot of free stuff as well and many alternatives for some play store things as well and offcourse the store is growing each day final verdictgo for this phone pals those who want to try windows also those who are sort of budget buyer looking for quality
1558	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	mobile was just awesome i heard this mobile has touch problem but honestly i will say it dont have any touch issue but touch was not sensitive like nokia lumia device but everything was awesome in this mobile thank you amazon for delivering within time
1559	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	i had bought it for my parents since one can resize the app shortcuts on home screen windows phone was my first choice i needed decent camera with flash easy manual decent ram and good battery backup lumia 535 meets all these expectations
1560	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	microsoft got everything right in this phone i can confirm that the touch issue is completely fixed by microsoft via the update and its now working perfectly fine mine was manufactured on 2nd feb and may be theyve fixed the issues for this new batch of devices 1 fantastic cameras both front and rear 2 the big screen and the build feels light and solid its as same as nokia lumia phones 3 lumia apps such as mix radio lumia camera rocks 4 again touch feels fantastic and the screen is responsive as much as any phone 5 as usual being a windows phone there is no lag whatsoever feels fluid and fast 6 gorilla glass 3  important reason to consider this mobile from others its scratch resistant and sturdy well many more are there if youre looking for a fantastic smartphone experience at this range look no further get the lumia 535 and enjoy amazon did a fast delivery 128522 will post about battery life in couple of days overall im fully satisfied with this device thank you microsoft and amazon   update  the battery lasts easily for one day with moderateheavy usage you can easily take it for two days if you use your phone for calling and texting gaming does consume a bit of juice faster but it is expected at this price rangei wish the battery was 2000mah but its good as i saidgood thing is that you can play most of the games from the store even the graphic intensive games like asphalt 8 it doesnt lag and thats one more advantage of this phone again im satisfied with this device   update 2 i see many people saying that their screen getting magnified suddenly thats not a bug but a feature in all the lumia phones and is called screen magnifier to disable it open settingsease of accessscreen magnifier toggle it to off you will be done also i installed the windows insider app and got windows phone 81 update 2 which brings a improved settings app app permissions and double tap on the navigation bar to sleep its running smoothly without any bugs try updating to this version on your own risk and understand that it may even take you to windows 10 tp directly here are some useful tips 1 to make your battery last long disable double tap to wake 2 if you feel your lumia camera app takes around 2 seconds to load and you miss the best moment to click then you can use the default camera app which is not accessible in lumia 535 from the app list so to use it open your photos appsettingsdefault camera app in that list select microsoft camera now open settingsnotificationsactions select the camera in quick actions in any one of the four places thats it now you can open microsoft camera app using the quick action shortcut even from the lock screen so that your camera is ready anytime for you d enjoy
1561	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	got this for rs7130 works great and i didnt see any issue with the touch screen so far as reported by many others camera quality is pretty decent both front and back if you are switching from an android phone it will take some time to get used to the windows os but the look and feel of the windows system is far better than my old phone although the phone box and package were poor infact the phone box looked pretty old even though the product was quite new
1562	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	naushad good mobile
1563	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	the delivery by amazon is awesome got in three days even it said it would take four to seven days  i ordered this for my mom and i am not at all satisfied with the product if you are planning to buy this as your primary phone i suggest you to change your mind my two stars are for its front facing camera and this is a bit faster than my two years old samsung galaxy grand pros 1 5 mp frontfacing camera gives best quality pictures compared to nexus 5 one plus one and some samsung galaxy phones 2 low cost with 534 screen  cons 1 microsoft windows os has a lot of bugs with its touch screeni am not sure if the fault is with hardware or with os 2 microsoft store is a kid compared to play store youll find a lot of differences between popular apps like facebookmessengerwhatsapp from android version to windows version you cant log out of messenger app from windows store 3 user interface is not at all responsive
1564	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	good service by amazon product reached on time about the phonewill just summarize in the following points pros very light weight 5mp front cam gorrila glass display  cons dull looks not so impressive processor windows os might need sometime getting used to   overall a decent phone though value for money  isnt as great as offered by competitorsin the same price range
1565	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	this is a review after 2 days of use pros this phone can work with 2 micro sims secondary cam was very good for selfies the touch was very good and smooth the gorilla glass is also very nice cons the primary camera quality was fairly good the led flash is just for name sake no that much usable heating while on calls tooo finally i purchased this at 7499 inr which was a good price for the features but the actual price 9500 inr is a little bit more than the features amazon policy the amazon do not have a replacement while others have which was a major disadvantage so beware before you buy if you have any problem you only have a refund option and leave you to buy at a higher price
1566	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	my friends there is touch and zoom issues in this phone but we can solve it update software of your lumia 535 then use mate screen guard on itit will work fine as other lumia devices and 2nd for zooming use camera360from store then there will be no other problems on it
1567	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	really awesome only touch problem after matte screen guard even that issue solved
1568	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	mobile is really not upto the mark sometimes getting hang cant be able to download some apps from the storenavigating is too worst i wanted to return this product but unfortunately the return policy period is crossed
1569	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	i like the amazon service its quick and reliable now come to the product its my first smart phone at this price range its a great phone its not for game addicted person but if u love games it got plenty of games positives 1 5mp camera for selfie 2 1 gb ram 3 clean interface 4 smooth touch response negative 1 no 8gb rom only around 74gb available out of which u can use only 35 gbbut u can uninstall pre install apps 2 no hd recording 3 no hd screen
1570	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Black, Dual SIM)	theres a major problem with the phons touch the touch is lagging bigtime no problems whatsoever with the seller or amazon the product per se is defective pl pick back the product ad return moey
1571	Micromax Unite 2 A106 (Grey, 8GB)	dont get fooled by 8gb memory tag as i did its memory for application installation is only 089 gb many applications like facebook whatapp etc can not be transfered to sd card 089 gb is not at all sufficient youll get memmory insufficient message just after installing few apps suggested solution by many users is not to take update of applications to save memory because preinstalled app consumes very less memory like 67 mb and after you take update same app expands to 3040 mb leaving very less memory of other apps to install furthermore back button is weak or something i dont know but it does not work many times you need to press it 34 times to make it work moreover connectivity to wifi network is very poor need repeated efforts and several restarts to connect to home wifi network even after conneting internet works for few minutes then stops working while internet works on other devices at my home dont know the reason in conclusion i would like to say although it is a phone with best specifications in this price range it is having abundant issues i do not recommend it to anyone
1572	Micromax Unite 2 A106 (Grey, 8GB)	i buy this phone but unfortunately it  not working fine  problem is no sim card network detecting some time is come and gone i go to the service centeronce time it ready and next day same  problem no network  and  now it in service center

1574	Micromax Unite 2 A106 (Grey, 8GB)	i would just limit my reviews to points rather than lengthy paragraphs  10004 display good for this price range the colors are much warm you better be a fan of warm colors for buying this handset 10004 touch response quite good and no delay yet 10004 camera the camera part is fine for the price the images are kind of a sharp with enough light low light performance is on the down side but acceptable 10004 overall handling the phone got a 47 inch screen which can easily be used single handed easy for call reception and all 10004 battery the battery life is average will last for a full day if you are an average user 10004 performance the performance is quite goodhandles most of the games with ease the android ui is good and smooth sometime only in some casesit lags if you have so many background apps runningbut its normal  10004 conclusion i would say its an ok handset and a value for money stuffi bought this for 5k if you can get this at this price then its a good bargain  10004 after lolipop update lesser space to install apps new display profile and other lolipop features
1575	Micromax Unite 2 A106 (Grey, 8GB)	internal storage is showing very low and cant download and install any apps from play store to phone storage
1576	Micromax Unite 2 A106 (Grey, 8GB)	awesome phone go for it if you are constrained by your budget and wish to have the kitkat android experience  pros smooth ui awesome screen good gaming performance decent looks good build quality front cam light sensor flash accurate gps lockon decent battery life decent camera quality  cons micromax bloatware unwanted crappy preloaded apps  you can disable it but uninstalling them requires your phone to be rooted low internal storage capacity better not install updates for unused google apps average video recording quality no gyroscope so cannot take photospheres slightly heats up near the camera while running heavy applications  and regarding amazons service satisfied product delivered intact on the promised day itself but just after i bought the phone the price dropped by 300 bucks by the same seller cant blame amazon for that  keep up the good work micromax and amazon kudos
1577	Micromax Unite 2 A106 (Grey, 8GB)	sir we have recieved defective item as they said internal memory is 8gb but it only contains 200mb thats it so mobile is hanging not working properly if we open any file it will open after 5sec so please exchange my mob with new one otherwise refund our money as i already mentioned about this problem earlier but they are not giving proper response dont buy this product in amazonquality is so pooreven flipcart is better than this
1578	Micromax Unite 2 A106 (Grey, 8GB)	phone is bang for the buck  currently you wont get any other phone with so many features and almost no bloatwares for this price moto e is good  i dont deny that that but it lacks many important features that the micromax has front camera apps movable to sd card etc to name a few  pros  1 the quadcore processor does its job well games like ashphalt 8 dead trigger2 frontline commando etc run on the highest settings i repeat highest settings  absolutely smooth the touch response is also awesome 2 there is no laag whatsoever while navigating through the menu 3 wifi direct wifi hotspot wifi tethering bluetooth tethering works absolutely fine 4 after installing following apps a facebook b facebook messenger c whatsapp d team viewer e flashlight a all that makes your camera flash as a torch  f linkedin g skype h clean master i book my show j bs player k flipkart lpda net mtimes of india n safari book reader  and the following games a ashphalt 8 b frontline commando c dead trigger 2 d temple run e sky force i still have about  100 mb of internal space for app install  564 mb  total 965 mb  of ram free  5 video calling with skype and my wifi was nice picture quality of 2mp front camera is good 6 5mp back camera is ok sometimes lacks the clarity but its faaar better than moto e 7 hd video recording is alright 8 i use whatsapp facebook  facebook messenger gmail and times of india all the time after that the battery stays for about 18 hours please dont expect this batterly life if you are using the phone for gaming  9 screen quality is good there is no pixalation anywhere and 199ppi is according to me perfect for the screen size 10 phone plays 1080p and 720 p videos without any issue if you are not getting sound with inbuilt android player for mkv files please use bs plater free 11 the google voice search can do wonders play you a song set a alarm for you find a place for you search nearby hotels and show you the way all by just speaking to it and no typing  cons  well guys and girls after getting so much from the phone in this price range its taking time for me to think the cons  1 it gets a little heated where the micromax logo is  on the back side when playing games for long of doing heavy wifi downloads but nothing that makes it unpleasant to use 2 camera could have been better 3 while playing games or using video chat or wifi download batterly gives about 79hours  this may get reduced in future as we keep using the phone but micromax has given us a removable battery as well 4 sometimes face unlock does not recognises me 5 no back covers still available in bangalore only screen guards not a con of course thats all folks  nb those people who are complaining that there is less internal memory and not all apps can be moveable to sd card please note that most of the apps are moveable to sd card including facebook whats app etc  without rooting your device search in googleyoutube 34 move android apps to sd card without rooting 34 and you will get the solution

1581	Apple iPhone 5s (Gold, 16GB)	giving feedback after using iphone 5s last 25 days i ordered this phone on amazon diwali dhamaka deal  29999 i got amazing deal with best price it is brand new genuine apple iphone in sealed box with accessories having apple india warranty i did not have any problem till date
1582	Apple iPhone 5s (Gold, 16GB)	bought 32 gb model after using iphone 6 for a month i switched to 5s this is the best premium phone in the market if one handed use is one of your criteria i couldnt get used to large screen of iphone 6 as it impaired one handed usability which has always been very  important for me i find the 434 screen perfect for my use and it isnt too small to watch a video or play a game if you are fond of large screens dont go for 5s as for performance it is almost as fast as iphone 6 to handle your daily usage i dont play graphically intensive games which probably would be more fluid on iphone 6 but otherwise it is lagfree phone dont compare specs of iphone with android as ios is built on a different platform dual core processor and 1 gb ram on ios would give you a better user experience than most android phones with much higher specs  another big reason to buy this phone is the price of 32 gb version 16gb isnt just enough for anybody i guess iphone 5s 32 gb is 62 15k cheaper than iphone 6 64 gb

1584	Apple iPhone 5s (Gold, 16GB)	awesome product from apple ever i had purchased this product from amazon to add upto my apple environment at home at first i was little worried whether to purchase it from eretail store or from some offline store as most of the ecomm websites including amazon did not mention anything about 4g support which is the main reason i am upgrading from samsung s4 since i found a great deal from amazon i booked it on the night of january 25th then i had sent my query to cloudtail who is the selling this product in amazon amazing thing is i got an instant reply from the cloudtail about its 4g compatibility i got the product delivered to me on january 26th morning even though i did not opt for express service the product is 100 genuine apple iphone it is imported version and it is compatible to airtel 4g lte services as airtel uses 2300mz range for 4g services or band40 most of the imported phones especially imported from us are not supported in india 4g services  thanks for amazon for providing me best deal and amazing experience
1585	Apple iPhone 5s (Gold, 16GB)	i received the phone on time thanks amazon  very first thing after getting phone i checked the warranty period and it was exactly one year so rumors regarding warranty were false  product wise its being a month i am using and no problem faced till now apple is always best in product quality  completely satisfied with product and amazon service 5 start
1586	Apple iPhone 5s (Gold, 16GB)	i dont like to carry bricksized phones like nexus galaxy iphone 6plus etc iphone 5s is just perfect for me prior to this i was using a lumia720 which was a good phone i must say besides i have a obsession about the brand of apple decision to buy a 5s was more inclined towards the brand obsession and of course the size factor iphone 6 looks more like samsung i got it from amazon  32k  now lets talk about the featurei am not a techfreak neither i use too many apps nor i stayed glued to my phone whole day its pretty fast with its 1gb ram in battery backup my lumia was better in browsing it has got the advantage of 4g but that you get with nexus and i believe in samsung highline as wellnever explored samsung ios is good or precisely i should say that apple hw and ios are just made for each other but converting everything to itunes is a pain unlike my windows phone where you dont need any pcsuite just drag and drop works never likedused android though some of very essential apps like skype whatsapp have very poor ratings in appstore so before going for ios just browse the appstore for assessment of your needs  overall i am satisfied with the phone but that varies from person to person
1587	Apple iPhone 5s (Gold, 16GB)	hi to tell frankly i worried a lot regarding my online purchase for an mobile but for my suprice it was a awesome traction for a genuine product as it is amazon the delivery was sweet just next day and regarding product it was just as i expected with a proper invoice bill and this was the best deal i found in online so over all its a happy deal

1589	Apple iPhone 5s (Gold, 16GB)	iphone 5s does not need a reveiw all ill talk about is amazon and its vendors order from seller gabbardealscom if there is not much price diff from other sellers never every buy from gadget direct they are not worth it they dont respect there customer the product was super delayed was meant as a gift for somebody on his bday while placing the order the estimated deliver date was 11th october bday was 13th i received the phone on 14th that too after chasing them and following them like crazy order was placed on 6th october who in the world waits so much for a new phone they have no courtesy at all say big no to gadget direct and make sure your product is sent by amazon transport service and not by blue dart blue dart was the courier company which delayed the product  about phone a brief price 34240 and 34282 5th and 6th october 2014 features best in class touch superb touch idfingerprint scan far better than expected battery is really nice as compared to samsung and other androids online video streaming is amazing phone is a value for money max price to buy this phone should not be more than 38k
1590	Apple iPhone 5s (Gold, 16GB)	i will not post a review about the phone since the whole lot of customers and the experts  have already done that instead i will stick with the basics item was received in perfect condition no issues so far i have been using it for more than 6 months now seller is genuine shipping was fast and yes i have warranty 
1591	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	i had purchased oneplus one sandstone 64 gb phone from amazon on 11022015 was really excited with all the buzz in the market and to my satisfaction the phone was awesome as expected however after some days my front as well as the primary camera started giving very poor quality pictures i had visited oneplus service centre at borivali on 5315 where i had demonstrated the camera problem to the technical person the concerned person naivita had verified the problem and has issued me a job sheet dated 532015 the jobsheet is attached to this mail the service centre informed me that the phone will have to be submitted and they will further transfer the phone to the andheri service centre located at marol they further told me that the phone will be replaced and i will get my new phone after 15 days i requested for a standby phone from the service centre since till 20 days i will be without phone but they refused to give me any standby phone thereafter i communicated with the andheri service centre i informed them about the camera malfunction and requested him to replace my phone as soon as possible because i have several clients call to be made and received daily without phone i will be handicapped and my work will suffer extremely to my surprise the person informed me that from last one month they have not received any consignments of new phone from oneplus company which can be replaced for faulty phones he further informed that until they receive new phones they cannot replace my phone by any means if i order phone from amazon i receive it within 2 days and from your service centre i am receiving all the rubbish reply moreover whenever i call at both of these service centre borivali and andheri the phones are either kept aside or they keeps on ringing indefinitely this seems to be a very unsatisfactory and an unprofessional act from the company as well as the service centre peoples if replacement of phone is taking long time then at least the company can give to their customers to use a standby phone what will a person like me do if the phone is not replaced for a month shall i purchase another phone for a month of course not i have constantly communicated with support centre as can be seen from this trailing mails however they also do not have any satisfactory answers what will a person like me do in this situation i have faced lot of problems because of your un professional act
1592	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	awesome phone got share able  invite any one interested let me know  please share the details and process to share the invite
1593	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	this is ridiculous after sale services i have submitted my phone on 4th march 2015 till today i havent got any replacement though my cell phone under warranty they refused to give a new one within a month it started facing restart problem which service centre agreed and promised to give it within 5 working days which is still not fixed their customer care centers dont have any answers with regards to the phone they just keep pushing dates this is the third week i have been told you will get it on friday and every friday they says please check back by monday or tuesday  i am really fedup as i purchase my phone and not even used for more than 15 days its with them since then  i beg you all please dont buy this phone go for samsung or iphone for best quality and services
1594	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	with an unbeatable price and power to spare the oneplus one is an android revelation that challenges expectations for affordable smartphones  reception and call quality very clear sounding voice noise cancellation works great the other way  display super sharp pixelpacked with adjustable auto brightness for every level of ambient light good color reproduction warm hue helps prevent eye fatigue  battery life amazing ive been consistently getting 2 full days with light use 15 with medium use 1 full day with really heavy use about 7 hours fullon nonstop blast  camera does very well in all lighting conditions great detail in shadows nothing to complain about leading cameras are just a little bit better but not much  ease of use twohanded is the way to go but i have small hands awesome grippy back and sides with sandstone cover the os is so tweakable its ease to use for everyone  design and form factor looks and feels top notch samsungs and lgs feel very flimsy in comparison amazingly good to hold sexy to look at i reach for it just to feel the sandstone  portability size  weight fits in my pockets no problem thanks to slimmer sides feels very slim weight is right on the money  light but not too light  media support supports full hd video what more do you want  detailed review   heres the deal this phone is right up there with the best even before we consider its price  if you absolutely need waterproofing go for a xperia and youll be happy if youre a sucker for samsungs alice in wonderland saturated colours  go right ahead for it if you absolutely positively believe the iphone is the best period theres nothing that will change your beliefs but if you just want a great phone  you will be very happy with the oneplus one  i think 99 of people would be very very happy with this brilliant pleasant to hold and to use device  and then take the price into account  top android handsets are twice as expensive the gbforgb inchforinch equivalent iphone 6 plus costs three times more it just isnt three times more phone now is it
1595	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	many bugs are there testing hadnt done much even though snapdragon 801 performs better wifi display use case has lot of frame drops tethering is not at all working with recent sw update some basic video clips are not working these are the basic use cases users are expecting these days please fix them soon
1596	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	heres a quick review after using the mobile for about 5 days will keep updating as required  without going too technical here are my first impressions about the phone  packaging this is the best packaging i have seen done for any mobile phone with the obvious competition of apple products this is as good as how apple packages their ipods iphones etc detailing is given to every single piece of the box the same detailing has also been given to every components inside the phone whats included in the package is mobile phone data card beautiful red one sim ejector tool and charger no headphones please buy one separately  looks when i first opened the box i was disappointed to look at the size of the phone i looked huge i am currently using lumia 625 and galaxy s advance compared to that this looked really big then when i took the phone in my hand i was surprised to its weight i was looking for a battery in the box because a phone of this size cant be so light eventually i was sure that the battery is nonremovable and already in the phone also it is a big phone but the ergonomics are right so using it is not a difficulty as with other large phones the back looks quite different sandstone back reminds me of resinemery paper used to rub the walls it doesnt slip at all due to this  display it has one of the most beautiful displays i have seen i have amoled display in my s advance but this display does not over do it its just perfect from every angle i am in love with its display  customization there is a tonne of customizations possible which i have not fully explored yet to be honest you can make your phone look the way you want to apple restricts this a lot  camera i have selected the photo size as 13m and i believe thats the setting for 13mp photos it clicks awesome photos many a times the photo looks good in the phone but when you transfer it to an ipad or laptop and zoom it it gets grainy the photoshots from this mobile is just amazing i am truly enjoying the capturing i could read the texts very far away when i zoom it also colors and saturation are just perfect has a decent front facing camera as well for skype or video calling never tried though  battery i must make a mention of this because this is one area i have never been satisfied except on my ipad i just love this it takes a while to charge almost 23 hrs but lasts almost 2 days on moderate usage 810 calls of 510mins duration 30 mins of gaming per day lots of browsing and 10 apps download per day few youtube streaming  call quality this was my one concern as i have tried few other phones earlier made in china where the call quality was not as good as a nokiaiphonesamsung but this mobile is just perfect after all the primary reason to buy phones is making calls atleast for me   sim card its not mentioned anywhere what kind of sim is used in this phone the default sim tray installed is for micro sim but there is a spare sim tray in the box that can also take nano sim smart move i must say  sound quality extremely good because the speakers are on the bottom of the phone unlike most phones where its on the back also two speakers are there for very good sound quality they are loud and clear  overall operation is quite smooth no lags or slow down  overall i was not let down by this phone and it has made me a happy owner i am not saying this because now i have to live with it but genuinely i am loving this mobile my only gripe is that they could have provided a screen protector
1597	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	dear team  i had purchased one plus one from amazon i was really enjoying the phone with its great features camera sound with other features are very well but from last few days it is getting worse day by day the problem i saw was battery issue automatic switch off getting hanged voice issue etc these are the few issues i was observing with others also first time i went to mumbai service centre from pune for only a battery issue second time i gave it to pune service centre but very poor response from their side i feel they dont care the one plus one customer team they are saying 34hum kuch ni kar sakte 10 din ho gaye he to bhi 15 din or lagenge34 i am completely annoyed with their service they are useless people i am not able to understand why company authorised these type of peoples to handle the after sale service arent they aware that after sale service is as important as making a sale expecting an adhoc revert from team  request you to resolve asap  ca deepak kabra 919960923785 918237033446
1598	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	i have purchased the 822018221 last month and i had gone the bad experience phone touch has been broken to fall down from 2 to 3 ft height this was happened with my other phones too but never see the experience like this  not satisfied with quality of product and one more information i had contacted the service center and they told that they don8217t have the touch panel alone and the whole front will be changed which cost around rs 12000 inr it is too high for me after spending good amount on 1 last month only  i was previously impressed with the configuration but this type of service is ridiculous i have no other option rather than replacing the whole frontattaching the picture for your ref please suggest if you have any better option for me   regards janinder jain m 919818799954
1599	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	one plus one is having worst service once you get any problem in it i had purchased 64 gb hdd and it started giving problem in just after 1 month i had given the phone to their pune based fourtech technologies service center on 21st feb15 and i have still not got my phone when i call one plus customer care number i did not get proper reply pune center not even pickup call overall not happy with this kind of behavior out of 1 year of warranty my phone is with one plus service center for 3 months

1601	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	i wish i could give it 0 but i dont have the option it works well so long as it does but if you ever face any problem and had to deal with their customer care you will cry rivers i will never recommend this phone to anyone i dont need an egg shell delicate phone and a hard of hearing customer support i have never heard such vague answers from any customer support even government offices are more responsive these days   suggestion to everyone please read threads on service related nightmares people have had before buying if only i had done that before
1602	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	touch screen issues and nonexistent customer service here is my experience with oneplus one no exaggeration just facts i bought this phone on february 2015 it was the perfect companion for about 15 months on a hot and humid day of april 1st week the touch screen stopped working temporarily from then on i started to experience frequent issues with touch screen like multitouch not registering ghost touches and disabled touch panel i raised a ticket for replacing the phone on april 15 i was informed that there is no replacement policy and the phone will only be repaired since then i would have sent scores of mails and called them a dozen times but as of now may 25 40 days after raising the ticket there is still no sign of any repair as this is a new company i expected some problems in service however the touch screen issues are being experienced by a lot of people showing that they have serious quality control issues the way they handled my service ticket shows that their customer service is also bad so heed my advice and stay away from this phone and the company
1603	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	all  when i have received this mobile it was like a smooth sail with all the applications without any hassles but real story started after a month when every thing started getting hanged even contacts were getting crashed watsapp was working like it was a testing app which was first launched on my mobile for test getting hang and crash every moment when i try to get in horrendous experience came when phone started getting burning hot even nothing was in use forget to use it if its getting hot in idle state noticed restarts when phone changes its internet networks ie from 2g to wifi  what else i can say  i have contacted customer care and found fourtech computers as service guys in pune initially i have got the address from google but to my surprise the shop was not there and i have been directed by locals to some 3 kms from the site mentioned on internet reached their only to find that shop is having franchisee of other mobiles as well like xiomi lenovo mi  etc it too me 3 hours to get my number and finally given the cell to them highly unprofessional staff with very less customer care experience infront of my customers were pissed of of getting gadgets unrepaired  even after leaving them to the stores for 2 months   so reality is i have been said on phone that your mobile has issues and motherboard needs to be replaced they have told me that tuesday you will get it but now its sunday and i am confident that even after a month i will get some same replies  i request you all to have a think before buying such lucarative cells whci do not have confidence base in the market thinking to buy some different cell now  do not waste your time in getting invites  save people money by not giving any more invites   yash cheers
1604	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	phone is excellent as the specs might suggest whatever is on paper it delivers every bit of it however the bad part starts when something goes wrong i accidently got a slight crack ok the screen the fall was from a height of barely 1 or 2ft that was enough for it to make a hairline crack on the screen and guess what the entire screen became unusable called customer service there replacement charges 10600make sure to look at these aspect before you buyleft it like that will buy mi4
1605	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	hi team  its been a month 6th feb 2015 since i bought this phone and im pissed off with its malfunctions  the phone has heating issue and i wouldnt be surprised if the coolant gel melts  the battery drains very quickly and i get a backup of less than half a day  the touch doesnt respond at times i have to reboot my phone everyday and trust me i dont expect this performance in the very first month where my utilization is quite normal  whats wrong with the hardware of this phone the power button and the double tap option to wake doesnt work this could be a defective piece in the lot however i dont like myself being a bait  i love the camera display and sound  ps  i have tried all potential solutions wrt settings cache clearance reboot and factory reset from my end i dont think any new consumer deserves this
1606	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	i thought it has to be the best configuration and tried all my network to get the invite but post purchase feel too dissatisfied i bought the phone and spent good amount of time to configure and to get familiar with the phone this phone has problem with its mic the person on the other side is not able to hear my voice at all even with some earphones it gives some different sound effect i wonder how can they sell such defective pieces the battery charger cord has some problem it will work only when it wants too i have too struggle to start the charging i did raise complaints with their call center who suggested to do hard reset and even emails to their email id who suggested the same even upon doing hard reset the issue still exists i have written so many emails but there is no revert from anyone there i then visited the hcl service center opo has tied up with them but that was also in vain since they are not authorized to open the phone wonder what to do now
1607	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	its the best phone that you can buy at this time and the ban is also lifted up the delhi high court over it its not having any problems like call issues or yellow band issuesi dont know why people are writing those false reviews courier service of amazon is also goodi got it within 3 days chose standard delivery best phone to buy at this price range battery life is also amazing can see in screen shots seriously a flagship killer
1608	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	one word for it premium  right from the packaging to the phone itself this proves how much money other companies make while selling so called flagship phones agreed that the advertising and rd budgets push their cost but the one is the perfect example of what can be achieved d  detailed review  real world nontechnical  design and build the moment you open the box you realize that this is not a phone which is cheap on the outside the build quality is beyond excellent and the crafting of the entire phone is done meticulously the back surface is what stands out as it helps in this large phone from not slipping off your hand i am not going to describe the technical details of the build and external features its all there all over the internet but after using the phone for nearly a month now i can say that everything on the phone body is made to work and last the phone is very pleasing to hold in the hand the simplistic design philosophy works beautifully and i love it for most of the time its perfectly usable with one hand the usb connector cable and the charger are also excellently built in all this is closest to an apple device i own many apple devices in terms of its overall build quality  hardware the screen is gorgeous to look at its brightcrisp and color accurate to great extent i do have the dreaded yellow tint issue and i did report to amazon about it but nothing happened post that having said that even though it may seem annoying there are ways to not make it visible via a software fix and for me it works not having a phone like oneplus one in hand once you get used to it versus having it with the minor issue is not something i could do every technical device can have nagging issues and its up to you to decide how much of it can be ignored over everything else that device has to offer  the back camera is good and although there might be better cameras in other phones i being a photographer by profession can say that it works perfectly for what a phone camera is meant to do it also shoots images in raw adobe dng and produces files of around 16mb each which can be edited in professional applications like photoshop and lightroom later to satisfaction  the front camera is again decent and works perfectly low light performance in both the cameras are satisfactory to a level where it will never annoy you  software since the release of the device there has been a lot of confusion and drama regarding the software running on this device the version of cyanogen loaded on the device works beautifully for most of the time again with all softwares bugs will always be there the gesture and lock screen issues crop up sometimes but again with few tweaks one can avoid it the phone has never hung during almost a month of continuous use even with some serious amount of multitasking now since cyanogen wont be officially updating india specific devices the ota wont happen but flashing of new version is still legal i can only wait and see what the oneplus ones own software will offer but for now the current software is top notch  a few lines on the battery performance of the device since almost all smartphone users have this as their biggest concern its battery performance stellar  i havent ever used a phone as big and beautiful as this which lasts this long period 
1609	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	well i have read almost all reviews posted by opo lovers  i may not be able to find an unused word to describe the excellency of this phone because many of you have covered the most however i would definitely try my best to tell what i felt about the phone  1  look  the sexiest phone which you can get at this price though it is 5534 screen feels like you are holding a nexus 4 in your hand  i have used it before back finish gives an excellent feel and grip it surely makes you unique  2 chipset and display  well frankly saying i am not a geeky guy to mugg the features and varietys of chipsets available in market but i can surely tell you that this phone  never say no to all your apps and games enormous 3gb of ram provides you a countless opportunities to explore the world it comprises a very crisp and clear display i have used nexus 4iphone 4s xperia z lumia 920 desire 820 and recently had bought redmi note too but in front of this beast no one even dare to stand  3 camera  its interface is awesome  easy to capture and also easy to chose manual exposure iso and effects captures detailed pictures in daylight but i have observed bit blurry images which were taken in eveningnight  i might write a book full of review just like the one of chetan bhagats  so stopping myself here i am definitely damn happy and enjoying my every moment with this phone   well  have you bought one  
1610	OnePlus One (64GB, Sandstone Black)	souped up machine with inherent performance faults does not even match basic expectations  sorry oneplusif you market something so well that its only by invite then please be sure of your products first  subway surfer drags gesture functions do not work video streaming collapses phone hangs for unknown reasons touch becomes non responsive for unknown reasons mobile internet does not worki am returning this product after 24 hours or receiving may be this review is becomes a reason for oneplus to improve if they have to survive in india

1627	Apple iPhone 4S (Black, 8GB)	very attractive in every features but the sound quality of incoming phone calls very low
1628	Apple iPhone 4S (Black, 8GB)	dont recommend amazon for phone bad service no replacement offered b b b b b  a a a d d
1629	Apple iPhone 4S (Black, 8GB)	good product have bought it akmost a month back and facing no issues tag on product packaging have manufacturing date as march 2015 and hence got a comfort on genuineness of the phone apple website recognizes the warranty  is valid till june 2016 at times i feel phone gets heated up especially on ussing 3g as well as sometimes while charging  another good thing is apple has announced ios9 which will be applicable for 4s as well it will help in getting more storage space as ios will require only approx 15gb of internal memory
1630	Apple iPhone 4S (Black, 8GB)	nice productdeliverd before timenice packaging1 mnth over but still not recieved the cashbackphone is excellent overall except its poor battery only 1430 mahhardly works a dayotherwise nice deal128522
1631	Lenovo A536 (Black)	not up to the expectations looks like a chinese mobile with full plastic body guus if you want a classy phone look wise dont go for this rather buy moto x while using internet battery consumption is more  camera is not at all good and is poor then phones having 2megapixel cameraonly good thing so far is its functioning speed which is quite nice
1632	Lenovo A536 (Black)	first of all i would like to tell abt amazon service this time and it was pathetic i ordered for 1 day delivery and it came after 4 days however amazon customer care helped a lot  now my review about the phoneafter 2 days pros  the look of the phone is amazing455  quad core processor doesnt give a damn about lag of hang455  varieties of inbuilt apps and lenovo added its own security app which is very fast and anyone will like it455  ram is also 1 gb so the phone runs smooth455  1080p videos running smooth no lag even if you forward the video455  proximity sensor and led light working fine55  back cover and screen guard given in the pack which is good from lenovo455  screen is 5 inch so looks great and useful also55  never the less android kitkat 442 is very good and works very fine with this device455  internal memory is 8 gb and usable memory will be around 45 gb which is also good455 cons  the first impression i got from the camera is not satisfactorystill i need to explore moreit should have been better355  battery is 2000 mah so i thought the backup will be highbut it drains out very fast within 6 hours when you will start wifi or data connection which is quite often in android phone but the mazor problem is it is taking more than 5 hours to fully charge the battery in switch off mode which i donno whymay b due to a new battery45  touch responsiveness is not up to the mark you need to press with little more power it is not as smooth as moto e45  sound clarity of phone is ok not so good but it is manageable 45  3rd class ear phone provided by lenovo i think they have forgotten that they are selling smart phones but providing basic phone ear phone however we need to use some other better ear phone255  hence if i overall rate it then i will give a 4 stars out of 5 as the price was 7199 when i bought this so i am satisfied with these pros and cons  i suggest if you are thinking about performance then go for it as it will delight you with its fast performance
1633	Lenovo A536 (Black)	please dont buy lenovo phones seeing at the cheap price there are network issues in the phone in the wifi connectivity as well worst phone and quality many review says what you get for this price60 well please pay more and only buy quality company phones
1634	Lenovo A536 (Black)	battery charges slowlybut discharges fastly battery is simply waste china mobile battery is better than this battery other things yet to get experience oh i forgot one more thing lenovo a536 does not recognize double entry of same mobilephone number or same name
1635	Lenovo A536 (Black)	good things good battery backup large enough screen fast smooth performance  bad things speakers and headphone quality is not good as i expect screen resolution is not that good no video call option in the phone
1636	Lenovo A536 (Black)	first i want to appreciate amazon that they deliver item in 3 daythnx  lenovo a536 is very good mob in the range of 7500ramcameraspeed all thing are good but speaker quality is not that much over all mob is very nice
1637	Lenovo A536 (Black)	recently i purchase this model on amazon this product is good but battery backup is not good backup is 67hrs only all function is working normal there is front camera open option not avalable so i download a apps then it working
1638	Lenovo A536 (Black)	great phone which has the capability to be equal with all the costlier mobiles the price in amazon is the lowest compared to all other sites battery back up is really good i have used this mobile for one week and the charge has never gone below to 50 though i use wifi regularly camera clarity is good and the 13ghz quad core processor is really fast and it supports many high end games the most important is the phone comes with the back cover and the tamper screen guard the only drawback that could be in this mobile could be the headset it should be replaced with a nice one
1639	Lenovo A536 (Black)	good phonebut there is no app drawer in itall app which installed will appear on home screensmooth processor cameraboth frontback not bad nice 5inch screen overall okay for this price
1640	Lenovo A536 (Black)	not a good product from reputed brand 34lenovo34  camera for taking photo as well videos not functioning properly unable to takeshoot videos  also sometimes hang problems
1641	Redmi 2 (White)	hardware problem relating to camera whenever i open camera app it always shows 34cant connect to camera34 when i called mi they dont give proper response and they also dont have pan india service centres they said if you to repair it go to service centre which is almost 400 km away from my city which is itself a state capital
1642	Redmi 2 (White)	the first impression is definitely good considering the cost appearance and handling quality i just changed from my samsung galaxy s3 and what i found in this is  pros 1 similar sized screen 4734 2 faster performance 3 simpler user interface thanks to miui 6 4 design and the plastic quality is quite good 5 the front camera selfie gives a good wide angle and nice range though its 20 mp it feels better than that 6 gives good network range and call quality 7 extremely good battery life it lasted 36hrs comfortably with occasional browsings too similar use from my s3 gave only about 12 hrs miui kills background apps but still this serves good if used in 3g network and travelling 8 lightning fast charging this helps you feel you never gets blacked out 9 phone doesnt get heated up so much even while using 3g 10 many themes are available giving you an option for customized appearance and styles 11 budget range better configuration  cons 1 though 1gb ram is available sometimes it doesnt feel enough yet it performs better comparing to other similar ram equipments 2 the builtin download application works all time so that almost all contents will be downloaded automatically too annoying there is an option to limit it to 512kb or wait for wifi but anything around will be shown as waiting to download and you will always need to clear this 3 if you dont open the developer option and customized phone options available for enthusiasts and experts you cant select options like 3g only hence the networks alternates regularly between 3g and 2g and your browsing will be affected well 4 many had told about lack of earphones in the box yes truly annoying 5 any application other than whatsapp will need special permissions to show notifications or else you will have to open the apps and check for latest notifications
1643	Redmi 2 (White)	first impressions  pros 1 looks impressive considering the cost it comes at 4734 hd ips display does its duty nicely and has great viewing angle curved edges and nice bezel gives it a premium look although the back cover is quite slippery a flip cover would be recommended  2 camera 8mp rear cam performs well in sunlight in auto mode low light might not produce the original colours and will have a yellowish tinge which is acceptable since it captures the pic with superb details 2 mp front cam is great for selfies and video calls fun fact front cam tries to guess the gender and age of the person looking at it  3 miui mobile comes with 44 kitkat out of the box with miui 635 upgradable to 652 miui acting as the upper layer of android is quite user friendly with many good features xiaomi has put some good working hours creating it  4 rom 1 gb ddr3 ram is sufficient enough for the cost and capabilities of this phone miui takes a major amount of ram but one should not complain about it as the phone doesnt lag with normal day to day operations it is not the kind of phone to be compared with high end flagship phones comparing it with it peers such as moto e ii gen lenovo a6000 plus redmi 2 wins hands down  5 overall xiaomi has worked hard to upgrade its redmi 1s and it shows at this point flipkart is offering exchange offer for this phone so have got it from flipkart at 5500 bangforbuck ordered it as a regular delivery and received it in under 2 days june manufactured phone  just pick it up without thinking twice if you are confused between moto e lenovo a6000 plus still selling under flash sale and other similar phones
1644	Redmi 2 (White)	pros  9733 9733good design 9733stylish looks 9733brilliant display 9733good battery lifegives around 150 days 9733fast charging 9733front camera is awesome for selfies and skype 9733call quality is very good as this has a second noise cancellation mic 9733good value for money 9733no heating problems cons  1 ram is lessif you are heavy user you might not like this phone very much less multitasking possible 2 apps not movable to sd card 3 no earphones in the box 4  i said 34battery last 15days34 why because miui kills all app in background you wont get app notification if not opened  note follow the steps to solve the whatsapp push notification problem on your redmi 2 device 1 go to the security app which is pre installed on the device 2click on permissions 3 click on autostart 4select whatsapp and turn it on for whatsapp 5 now reboot your device  same thing do it for other apps also at a time i am receiving all the notification whenever i switch on the data or wifi service same thing for multitasking if you want to run the process in background then do it open recent task panel just swipe down on any app and it will be locked then wont be killed this will solve your problem  overallits a complete package for basic phone users within 7k it has almost all the sensors and features that you need in a smartphone you can go for it 
1645	Redmi 2 (White)	love the phone had ordered it for my friend its certainly an improvement over its predecessor the redmi 1s which i happen to own the phone has a good and sleek design with curved edges and all is very light weight and feels premium all the way uses top quality hardware components and offers an impressive battery backup along with a very useful quick charge ferature miui v6 os from xiaomi does good with looks performance and is highly customizable the 8mp primary and 2mp secondary shooters on it are brilliant when coupled with miui v6 camera app we get really brilliant pictures and they fare above expectations when coupled with a decent pair of earphones dirac audio tech does magic to music and the speakers on the phone are loud and clear with impressive reproduction of depth and bass the phone doesnt heat up and offers good gaming experience with tons of sensors brilliant display and sound along with a powerful hardware although i never felt the need for more ram during my use extreme multitaskers will be left wishing for more xiaomi too does good with their customers listens to them and keeps them happy with updates and a lot of other services similar to apple another important thing is the really active miui forums  community officially supported by xiaomi which i found to be really useful while playing around with my phone  so on the bottom line compared with the likes of micromax yu yuphoria or lenovo a6000 the redmi 2 would be my choice any day as long as micromax yu continues its bad chain of customer service given the price tag of rs6999 the redmi 2 is a 100 vfm device that will amaze you
1646	Redmi 2 (White)	okay im going to be completely honest here  this phone is much more than how i expected it to be fast good camera really customisable fits perfectly in hand stylish design and much more the only problem i think it has is the fact that theres only 4 gb internal storage which might prove to be a problem for some gamers
1647	Redmi 2 (White)	i give it 3 stars after using it for around 3 months this phone is good in its price range all the other reviews which are already given for this phone match with it i would have given it 4 stars but what i have found a serious flaw in this phone this phone does not work on international networks  it does not have the frequency bands to support all gsm networks i found this when i got stuck because of this as it did not caught any signal when i was on international roaming on usa network it showed no serivce all the times i got the local sim from the local operator then too it did not work finally we found that it does not support enough frequency bands to support the networks i had to buy a new phone because of this i called their customer care wrote to them but they were not able to give any clear reply this is the biggest missing thing in this phone rest for india it works great but not for international travels
1648	Redmi 2 (White)	redmi 1s was the game changer in indian budget smartphone industry nothing could come even close to it but now with the redmi 2 there are quite a few others in the game too but in the end nothing beats the build quality the display clarity and color reproduction and the awesome camera of redmi 2 you might want to get a 5 inch device with 2gb ram for a price similar to redmi 2 but nothing would give you as good an experience as this device and it looks awesome too overall a definite yes for anyone looking to buy something near the 7000 range
1649	Redmi 2 (White)	very sorry to say but it was a bad choice  within a month phone is not working properly  its getting hang battery discharged in no time and the instrument becomes very hot no service centre available  i have lost my money by selecting this phone
1650	Redmi 2 (White)	in future i will never suggest this phone to anyone due to followings reasons takes 230hrs  for full charge sometimes its half screen becomes black after just over 1 month it hangs likes my 2 year old gionee e3 totally waste of money please do not go for specification alone also go for its quality worse phone i ever buy it beat the old record of micromaxx canvas hd2 star only for amazon service
1651	Redmi 2 (White)	dont buy this piece of holy crap dumb  phone the phone is heater in your hand test your patience in lagging dont dont buy now i want to return
1652	Redmi 2 (White)	the phone is amazingly of very good quality i am not a fan of android phones i bought it for my teenage daughter the tweeked android miui6 by mi to match the ios of apple phones has really worked wonders it just works without any lags and the tweeked android makes easier to configure the phone according to your preferences for both voice and data usage you can configure permissions for individual apps also this phone has really forced me to re think about further buying apple phones as i myself now plan to buy mi 4 64gb which is moreover a copy of iphone 5 s and is available at 30 cost of a i phone you can change your phone thrice at the cost u pay for a iphone and with all the limitations of transferring data associated with apple phones its better to buy mi phones mi is also  offering 10 gb free mi cloud storage with their phones for auto backup of your data in comparison to 5 gb being given by apple my only concern is how secure is your data with mi cloud in comparison to apples i cloud as apple has had a reputation of  having very strict security norms and till now has had no data leak instances at least in my knowledge  and u feel more secure if your data with apple 
1653	Redmi 2 (White)	been using it for exactly a month now so please add so far to each line of my review  very good phone battery life is my first excellence point if you use a lot of 3g it lasts one day else it easily goes on for one and a half day if wifi2g is your main usage ive started d reading comics and playing games since i got this badland skyward etc work without issues on this handset only sometimes with hardcore multitasking there is a minor lag the miui is quite nice as well its a tad bit slow but that doesnt really affect the performance speaker is really great microphone is decent too camera is good however the pictures turn out a tiny bit yellowish as the phone is completely modelled on the iphone and the camera too the back of the phone is a little bit slippery and overall the phone is a tad bit bigger than i would have wanted but ive gotten used to it  all in all really enjoying it so far
1654	Redmi 2 (White)	go for it the best phone you can buy at this price i will say it is a money worth product  pros its an amazing cell phone its  from xiaomi no heating problems while charging or heavy usage took 1hour 45 mins to charge from 10100 battery doesnt drain fast post heavy usage superb display and sound clarity both the cameras are amazing music player gives a excellent no lagcause it is a good stock rom you get decent amount of memory after the main app running you can root your phone at any time the company gives you full warranty even your phone is rooted  its a great option  cons the one and only con is that some of the apps in the stock rom are fully  to chinese version that is the only problem  guys who are writing about cons please have a look at its price if you guys expect a phone priced at 6999 to meet all your expectations
1655	Redmi 2 (White)	amazing phone it is phone of best phones under 7k camera is really awesome 8mp was good clarity and also front1gm ram really doing a great jobperformance is super and no lags in thismiui is superilove this very much thanks for amazon for faster delivery
1656	Redmi 2 (White)	screen is good build quality is good though the back cover is very slippery back cover is must hardly get 200 mb of ram free thats really bad camera is ok far below my expections mi ui personally i didnt like stock android could have been better battery is good not much of heating  problem it heats up little while multi tasking and last amazon took lot of time to deliver the product almost 10days packing was pathetic shocked to see that the box was wrapped with cutted corton sheet half rapped with tape amazon u r a international company learn how to pack mobiles packing was such that easily the delivery person can rwplace the product may not buy mobile again from amazon only for packing problem dont like the way amazon filer negitive reviews
1657	Redmi 2 (White)	nice phone with very very bad ram management although the phone software is up to date pros nice screen camerafor social networks looks goodlesser heating after software updatecall quality cons available ram i mean if you use fb messenger and whatsapp all together the ram left will he 80120 mb only so if you open a decent sized game or app then the phone will freeze for a second so that it can make some ram available for current app and after that your app will run smoothly but this phone doesnt hangs like other mobiles just some occasional freezes here and there i will recommend this phone only if you need a phone with good camera touch screen calling  and for average daily uses then only go for this phone
1658	Redmi 2 (White)	good phone i would have given 5 stars if it could have a better music player you need to add a better music player from play store if you need more controls and grouping of the files also the available ram is less as the miui takes a lot of ram you need to close some apps continuously to use other apps otherwise you will see a difference in performance  i face some issues with call quality at some places where i didnt face any issue with my earlier phone however the call quality is good at most of the places i think it depends upon phone to phone  pros good camera good looks good display lot of options for customization music sound is ok  cons not so good music player less  ram call quality
1659	Redmi 2 (White)	sir mobile me problems aa rahi h like hanging problem  flash not working properly

1721	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	pros 2 gb of ram glove sensitivity feature keyboard settings is great camera low light mode voice search its a cool feature try it and you will love it mira cast cool to control your computer remotely over wifi it can be used as a remote to watch a movie or browse etc cool whats next i really like how it shows my schedules in one screen in a tree format and also shows the time left for the event to occur  cons the media player does not have the common features like time slider or previous stop etc  the speakerringer volume is very low as compared to the loud indian traffic inbuilt battery conclusion from my experience i can definitely say that its the best phone but under priced drastically similar phones cost over 2025k and over all you get a asus brand  i think that this phone will surely be a game changer and the toughest contender in the price vs features market  i read some concerns that radio is missing in it which could be a game changer however the truth is that fm radio can be installed and played  i hope the above lines clear all your left over doubts for purchasing this phone  thanks for bearing my thoughts and experience 
1722	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	i did not buy this product from amazon but at present amazon will provide you the best price  i have been using this set for last 4 months and i am really satisfied with the product  pros  1 the look and feel is awesome this is light weighed and has good grip on palm 2 got bored with poor android os look try this with new look and regular support from zen ui team 3 useful zen customized feature on android os platform 4 no lag and works smoot zen ui clean up will free u from downloading clean up master from play store 5 camera has good quality enhanced options for various mode specially time rewind is favourite improves pic quality with useful edits 6 had a fall from a height of 1 meters no harm to screen and internally all working fine 7 asus customized setup can be set to capture screenshot by long press on menu this action is faster than any other phone  cons 1battery is a problemhas long been an issue with all asus products a power bank will be handy
1723	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	those people stating that it has a poor battery backup should get a life outside their phone and make sure they use their phone as a phone my battery lasts sufficiently well and iam really satisfied by what the product has offered me in this range the interface is amazing in itself also the camera provides vivid options its fun using this phone and if you are planning to get it add it to your cart already
1724	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	i am in love with this device want to know why lets find out  good points 1 the handset feels solid and sturdy the phones ergonomic design and good looks are its best features 2 5inch ips hd 720x1280pixel screen with corning gorilla glass 3 for protection the screens 294ppi pixel density makes text sharp and clear and the viewing angles are good 3 runs android 43 jelly bean and asus has promised that the handset will receive android 44 kitkat update 4 it features an excellent camera for the price 8 mp rear and 2 mp front 5  zenfone 5 is easily the best subrs 10000 android phone i have used there was no lag and multiple apps including heavy games such as asphalt 8 and dead trigger 2 were handled with ease thanks to its  dualcore 16ghz intel atom z2560 processor and 2 gb of ram 6 notification led  bad points 1 5 inch screen is highly reflective and gets washed out a bit in sunlight unless you really raise the brightness level 2 lowlight shots taken from its 8 mp camera had far less detail though noise was well under control 3 heat from the rear panel iss noticeable after long gaming sessions though not alarming the handset also does heat up a bit during prolonged data usage and calls  conclusion  the zenfone 5 is the first device to truly offer competition to the moto g
1725	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	it is the best budget phone currently in the market supports all high graphic games with fluent and excellent performance the rumour that it does not have fm radio is completely wrong it has got most useful apps are pre installed the drop down menu provides quick access to many necessary functions works really fast without any hang up problemsall credits to its 2 gb ram its not 1 gb as misdirected by some
1726	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	first of all 34worth for 900034  pros 1 2gb ram 2 16gb internal storage 3 16 ghz  with intel core processor 4 zen ui interface 5 colour quality 6 lots of updates from asus 7 no lag performance  cons 1 camera quality not that much but 34ok34 2 no earphones with this product  best to buy a smartphone for 9000 with these features  also amazon is trusty website than flipkart its my suggestion

1728	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	asus zenphone 5 is really good if you plan to buy a phone with budget less than 10k i have been using this phone for last 1 week observations found 1 very fast processing 2 multitasking 3 charges little slow  many people reported battery problem all you have to do is need to charge the phone till 100 led light chages from redorance to green use the phone till the battery reaches 1 then again charge it to 100 you have to repeat this at least 3 times then switch off the autobrightness option i have experienced 1820 hrs of back up if i played games and used internet battery will drain faster if you use online games the battery life max stands for 23 hrs usage is only attending calls and sending msgs  design and built quality are really good phone started heating at the back if you play games continuously for 30 mins or more
1729	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	i got charcoal black for rs 12916 with in 50 hrs considering remoteness of the delivery address fedex is the team after i booked it i dont know whether it is really better than motog but i liked the looks and the price which gave more features what moto gave may be motog2 is worth waiting now but motog2 still have not planned external memory though they are planning for more internal memory which will attract more features i liked 1  display quality 2  auto focused camera quality including video recording quality 3  device finishing 4  expandable external memory 5  zenui 6  gorilla iii scratch proof display glass  the few issues i could realize are 1  zenfones zenui should offer a close application button may be a wrapper over the current app on os level to avoid running apps in background even after we close the android app 2  battery specs are bit weak they should offer zenfone 6s strong battery on zenefone 5 i meant instead of 2100 they should offer 3000 capacity battery i am ready to upgrade my battery 3  asus have not yet released its own android kitkat 44 os for zenfone models this does not sound good for basic os version which itself is quite old now and google might be thinking to come up with 45 or 46 soon in future 4  provide separate configure app button which may provide one of the option that allows app to be run as service always or whenever required or a process also it should control and close services andor processes automatically if not being used by any any other userprocessservice this feature can always be coded as asus release its own wrapper over android flavor 5  would have been great if it was built water proof 6  speaker is not that powerful

1731	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	top phone in terms of priceperformance i am becoming a fan of asus products after using their notebook tablet and phone  which exemplifies top quality at a reasonable price with the exception of padfone infinity  which is their most innovative product but priced too high
1732	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	i bought my asus zenfone 5 gold 16gb mobile on 16 november 2014 from alpha vile parle mumbai before this i was using mini sim new mobile uses micro sim so shopkeeper cutted the sim using sim cutter and then i started using this mobile from that moment it started displaying the pop up very frequently to select network between sim 1 and sim 2 although i installed only 1 sim fed up with this for 1 week and thinking it could be sim problem i raised request to get new sim with old number retained i got new sim and installed into zenfone mobile after 10 days i bought new phone i also tried updating android software 45 times it loaded 500 mb of data each time but failed during installation of file policy of asus for new mobile replacement is 7 days is very short owing to my low self confidence on old sim i did not approach service center immediately which proved costlier after getting new sim with old number retained of vodafone it added further to my miseries as call were getting dropped between conversation the call duration could not go beyond 5 minutes pop ups were reduced but call were getting dropped when i used gprs connection with 3g internet frustated with this i contacted asus customer service center on 30 november by calling them and dropping them mail as well rcindiaasuscom  they adviced me to go nearest service center and get it serviced i stay and work at wakad pune and service center is at compuage infocom ltd sadashiv peth pune the distance between these two is approximately 20 kms 1 hour drive 1 way the service center works 105 and not open on saturday and sunday since i am it employee it is extremly difficult for me to drive and drop my new mobile at above mentioned timings i finally manage to drove all the way and dropped my mobile to service center on 2 dec 2014 i requested him to fix the problem at one go and not make me travel to and fro again and again i did share and provided screenshots of network drop to prove him mobile is defective technical assistant informed me to collect my mobile on 8 dec 2014 as it was fixed he assured issue is fixed and motherboard was replaced for the mobile android was updated to 44 from 43 he even did not make sure that problem is fixed and verified since motherboard was replaced i managed to collect my mobile on 10 dec 2014 it took me 1 day to realize that problem still stays in mobile calls were still getting dropped and if it stayed idle for 1015 minutes network goes blank i once again called technical service engineer that problem still persist with my mobile ruthlessly he said to come back to service center and get it verified there was no trust between me and service center guy of my words i returned my mobile to service center on very next day 11 dec 2014 he did not believe my words and used my mobile for 1 day to make sure what i was speaking was truth the moment he put up his sim and i called him his calls started getting dropped and sometimes message came that mobile is switched off i had to go to this limit to make sure that mobile definatly is defective one i had to prove mobile defectiveness and it was not responsibility of asus technical service center to make sure mobile is defective now technical service engineer did admit that mobile his defective and requested his regional service manager to replace it with new mobile so far on 16 dec 2014 there is no reply from asus service center guys ie technical assistantmanager about replacement of defective mobile mobile still is with service center guys i am very frustated owning new asus mobile and it turned out to be very bad experience dealing with service center guys nobody takes responsibility or trust words of customer it is really hard to believe this is coming from asus who built nexus 7 tablet which i own previously  i would not recommend this mobile owing to post service and dont care attitude of asus
1733	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	its been a month i am using this phone now and the phone meets every expectation i had in mind while purchasing it like camera quality front and back processing speed everything seems to work perfectly the hardware they have put together under 13k is quite good asus has also done quite a job developing its ui the todo list on lock screen and direct access button make the lock screen even better one thing i felt that asus need to improve in this phone is battery battery takes too much time to get charge and in the phone like this where process are running 247 the juice runs out very fast but still with minimum use of mobile internet and wifi i was able to get it to work for the whole day  all in all you can say that asus is able to give you some pretty good deal under 13k if battery isnt your concern i would defiantly recommend you to go for this phone
1734	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	the mobile is the best in terms of looks display clarity and camera i purchased it on 11th march 2015 but its shocking that with 3g use the battery life is only 3 hrs i am terribly upset that such a wonderful mobile battery is worse than any other in the market i suggest donot buy it i returned it on 22nd march 2015 at 11am and thanks to the prompt service of amazon that i received the refund in just 2 hrs unbelievable service from amazon
1735	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	people this is my latest review  this phone has the latest android thats 50 and even they will provide 51 update soon those who wants to buy the phone with latest software and fast processing go ahead   note the battery issue has being solved asus released few softwares which really solved the issue now battery easily last for day with normal use and only call and msg you can get more than one day
1736	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	the phone looks good feels light on my hands there is a increased heating only when i charge when compared to samsung but it is forgiveable camera is good interface is smooth i do not use a lot of games  overall a very good phone for under 10k there is almost no competition redmi note gets incredibly hot so this is an excellent alternative for people looking to buy that phone
1737	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	i loved it yes i did at first look ull fall in love with this phone looks are not all youll look into a mobile theres something more to it i am trying to give you a honest review since i am not a mobile jargon so mine is a base level review pros looks screen touch feel camera response gaming speed with no lags cons the battery is little low considering the specifications given in this mobile heating issue not easy after sales service no easy availability of  accessories  i am coming back after using this phone for one month21st oct14 1the best thing the zen ui it is a fresh out of the box interface makes the mobile lill different than the other smartphones available in the market 2 the camera does makes it a good out of the pocket handy device 3 the probem which i found was with the app running in the backgroundthe kill the battery like something can be resolved with app available on offer 4 battery is the biggest let down of this phone after charging it it shows 100 charged but after 1 hr or so if you keep it idle the battery will show 98 i saw that and the point is internet wifi nothing was on 5 ram is may be 2gb but at any point of time available ram is 1 gb max you need to refresh it every time youll work with it 6 yes it does give lag at the start of subway surfer game but as the game progresses it gets betterit behaves like a enfield bullet going ahead 7 internet usage is smoothlike maska with 3g 2g is also okay but 3g is better 8 every thing said and done but one must applaud asus for there rd and updates after buying this mobile i have received 4 upates including the  kitkat updateanroid 442 and few more firmware updates great job asus they are hands on better than any other competitorspecially better than lg and samsung  i have a lg mobile and also had an samsung mobile  i repeat once again i am not a mobile jargon what i have given here is a basic level review which i came across during my daily usage there are better sites to give you better review about this phone you can see ndtv gadget review  my last words are if you are looking for phone with in a range of 13000 and have no hang ups about the cons then this is the best decision that you can consider while purchasing a mobile because the company which offers this phone really works hard to make this one as the best option
1738	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	ordered this phone on 2402 got delivered on 2602 quick and excellent service from amazonin    totally in love with this new phone no issues with the phone  having a good battery backup great performance as well great camera features i would recommend this phone to others who are looking for a good phone under 10k   good work asus  amazon 
1739	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	i ordered an asus zenphone 5 16 gb from amazonin on august 06 2014 and the phone was delivered on august 21 2014 after calling amazonin and the courier gati pvt ltd  the phone would not charge more than 52 i called amazonin to see if the phone can be replaced unfortunately this service is not available in india the options i got was 1 return the phone for a full refund 2 show the phone to an asus service centre to avoid the hassle of returning the phone i took it to compuage infocom ltd in kolkata the phone was checked and they recommended the battery be changedno cost to me i was called after 4 days to collect the phone when i went to the service centre i was told that even with a new battery the phone was not charging beyond 62 and the service centre techs feel that the phone would need a new mother board i am to go back on tuesday september 02 to check if the phone has been repaired  it is a shame not only for asus but also for amazonin for dealing with distributors who sell faulty gadgets through amazonin its seems what you get is not what you expect and you just have to deal with a situations that just makes so angry frustrated and helpless  neville from kolkata
1740	Asus Zenfone 5 A501CG (Black, 16GB)	the following review is purely based on my experience with the product till now as of july 24th 2014 product can best be described classifying into three segments as follows 1look and feel all asus segment phones including this zenfone 5 has an cute slim look one cannot have fear of slipping out of handsits size happens to offer rich feel to hold weighing more than 145 gramsthe three touch switches present on the front panel you will not feel pixels at allthough the screen is of 5 inches as said the overall length is way more than 63 inches  2 functionality with its 2 gb ram  atom processor this works seamlessly without any hassles and hiccups  as many apps u open and run in the backgroundcamera gives excellent clarity at good light but slightly fails at little darkness but offers many features to your pictures taking each pic a minimum of 125mb speakers seem to be present only on one side of speaker net but has good volume on ear phone and good clarity on mic the constant andriod updates from asus team appear to show considerable change in which ever functionality they put oni had three updates so far this is a broad description of the functionality  3features this has wide number of apps pre loaded into the system like mailboxquick memo games of few varieties few messaging apps one browser and asus specific apps4 in number these are good to have and good advantage to get way off using typical usb cable for file transfer this looks very cool to use i didnt see any lag in the system so far after all putting all efforts to put on heavy loads  4 value for money i fee this is much better than its competitors motos in terms of its configuration speed heavinesslooks features yes gives good value to money which we spend on 13k  5  cask back on or after july 22nd i feel this would help you to make better decision while you choose your phone on android platform if looking for best featuresthanks
1741	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	the htc desire 626g birch white has cool looks the processor is not a 14gz qualcomm snapdragon instead its a 17gz mediatek one its octacore gpu is arm mali 450 mp and not adreno 306 gpu internal storage is 8gb contrary to 16gb specified in specs online sar value is 1340 wkg 1ghead and 0840 wkg 1gbody speaker is mono camera is good and takes fine picturesnot an excellent camera the ui is sense 53
1742	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	ive been using the phone since 2 weeksbought it from amazonin everything in the description is crap  its got a mediatek octa core processor not snapdragoninternal  memory is of 8 gbof which you get around 53 gb its a dual sim phoneirremovable battery coming to the product the first impression you get after you open the box is its lengthbreadth is too much mine is of white birch it looks cool apart from that its got a single speakerother is just an earpiecethe cameras are great both of themdisplay is amazingyou get it with htc sense 53 not 60 so it varies quite a lot from other desire family members with sense 60 battery life and sound quality are not appreciable it will last for around 812 hours if you use it continouslyi never got it struck till today so the ram and processor are just fineif you dont use too many apps at a time i would reccommend it for around 1415konly for display and cameras
1743	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	really good phone at this price camera is also very clear moreover octa core processor at the price of 16k from a company like htc makes gaming very smooth but the negative point is 1 gb ram
1744	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	overall a good phone but battery is its real problem  pros 1 nice display 2 videos play extremely smooth 3 camera very good but when zoomed it doesnt feel like 13 mp and front 5mp camera is above ok 4 speakers are loud and clear enough  cons 1 battery is extremely less only 2000mah it can be used in 34 hoursheavy usage and on normal usage it wont last even a day 2 low light imaging is like hell flash light is very good 3 ok build quality
1745	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	product listing says 626 the item delivered is as described in case of doubts regarding technical specs customers can go to manufacturer site works fine with reasonable number of apps do not overload your phone with apps as it has 1 gb ram only its a dual sim phone and supports 34nano34 sim only  internal memory rom  8gb physical size 533 available for storing apps operating system  442 android kitkat flash light  one at back side with primary camera 13mp camera quality of both camera seems good tempered glass  covers are available online for the phone battery  can not be removed by user nonremovable  you can search for alternative in microsoft lumia with lesser primary camera and processor
1746	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	after using 1 month if u want a stylish fone with best performance go for it octacore didnt left any work for ram to be hold so 1 gb of ram is enough for lag free experiance best phone for gamers decent look with matt finish body camera is clear and  good front cam is okay for video calling and selfies u r buying a phone for better photography go and buy digital cam 5 inch tall body fits in palm and better typing experiance value for money
1747	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	a very ordinary mobile lost my faith in htc would never buy again pros 1 fast processor 2 brand name  cons 1 very poor camera definitely not a 13 mp camera begs to be closed in room light 2 low sound from phone speakers 3 included speakers are pretty ordinary 4 htc sense is very basic basically its  a ruined vanilla android  final words go for moto g or put in a few extra thousands and buy galaxy s4 which at 16k is bang for buck believe me  just avoid this phone
1748	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	first class packing may manufactured phone awesome phone but without lollipop which was not expected anyways  it will eventually come and overall nice phone
1749	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	i bought this phone 3 days back  13k cons 1disply is amazing but at night even at zero brightness seema little powerful 2 both the cameras are greatpictures taken are realisticthough sometimes flash disturbes some photos 3battery is oki am a heavy gamer  browser 2000 mh battery gives backup upto 67 hrs which i think is good if yu re gaming  browsing at the same time overall a nice phoneim lvin it

1757	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	great productand the delivery was amazing
1758	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	whenthe competition is about giving 2gb nd evenn more to consumers htc is busy in launching 1 gb ram in this big amount segment  
1759	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	what forbids me to give 5star is average sound qualitypoor image quality in low light and unavailabity of good accessoriesotherwise awsome performance awsome design
1760	HTC Desire 626G+ (Blue Lagoon)	choose this if you are looking for design  weight display is not so brighter as the other androids within this priceoverall performance is good worth 13 to 14k
1761	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	so first things first i am writing this review based on a few hours of playing around with this phone at a friends place so keep that in my mind i obviously took feedback from my friend as well and i hope this review helps  the good  hd display the display quality is good and viewing angles are good too  4g support a phone at this price with 4g now thats awesome couldnt test the speed due to lack of support on the network but 3g speeds were pretty good  dual sim i find it really odd that value for money phone always have dual sim support but expensive phones from samsung and alike dont get an s6 or note 4 and you only get single sim support whats with that however both sims dont support 4g3g sim 1 supports 43g and sim 2 only supports 2g  good speakers sound quality is adequately loud and clear and dolby sound enabled  weight its not heavy and is very light to carry around  decent build quality okay its now awesome but for the price its not bad at all  battery backup not something i could test but while i played around it didnt seem to discharge very fast my friend said the same though his friend who had another a6000 didnt have such a great battery life i am not sure if its to do with any updates or software difference but keep that in mind if you are buying this phone  the bad  average performance surprisingly inspite of the specs i wasnt very impressed  no gorilla glass now you have to be really nitpicking at this price to complain like that i personally dont think its a big deal all glass scratches and and all glass breaks and i think thats what needs to remember  ram issues my friend told me that often he had to clear the ram i am not sure if thats got do with the apps he has but i think this can be fixed with an update or installing any of the system ram tuning apps   picture quality though its an 8mp camera the picture quality isnt that great same goes for the front camera decent for selfies but nothing great  3g calling the phone seems to lack support for 3g calling but i guess its not a big issue if you use other video calling apps like skype viber etc  the vibe ui i dont like it personally its clumsy and not very user friendly but you can install other launchers  do i recommend this phone oh god its a very difficult decision really because its a valueformoney but so are the so many out there now  but that said if you are looking at a value for money and want to avoid the chinese clones dont get the a6000 instead get the a6000 plus thats right the a6000 plus is the same phone but with more ram 2gb and more ram 16gb so it works and performs better and the price difference between the two models is around rs500  at the time my friend bought the a6000 he didnt know that but you can make a better decision   i hope this review helped you decide and if it did please click yes below encourages me to write and play around with more stuff i can share with you
1762	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	thought im not amazon verified user i purchased this phone on flipkarti just want let people or users know about the phone before they are going to buy amazing phone in one word i say but theres one major problem the battery takes exactly 5hours to full charge when you just put it down and it will take 630 hours to full charge when you using with charger plugged in but battery back up is good it last for 4 hours of continues gaming and sound quality is too good otherwise all is working great superb cameragood speed and 4g
1763	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	its an amazing phone   really its worthwaiting   in such a low price its nice   satisfied wid d battery backup  yeah it takes a lilbit more time in full charging   its slim  light   back side of d phone looks just awesome  cam quality is great  totally satisfied 
1764	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	i have satisfied with this actually this order contains gift but i didnt receive gift at all may i know the reason
1765	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	good budget phone but for a6000s price here rs 7990  as of this writing  you can buy lenovo a6000 plus  priced at rs 7499  which comes with 2gb ram and 16gb rom unfortunately a6000 plus is currently not available online on amazonin
1766	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	bang for the buck
1767	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	looking  slim as compared to other mobiles  but i am not satisfied with cam  better to compare standby  picture quality is super to compare other mob
1768	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	good phone
1769	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	very good phone  no hang or lags while playing games like asphalt 8  nice specs 
1770	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	very good cell
1771	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	nice phone weightless  slim with dolby looks like a apple os but a android
1772	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	it has a lagging problem while playing game and touch response is not up to the mark totally a bad phone
1773	Lenovo A6000 (Black)	i bought this phone 1week back great phone and all specification good
1774	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	i feel that if you are not too keen to do gaming and love to hear music see videos take decent photos and videos decent sound qualityand use social media apps like whatsapp facebook email viber skype with ample storage space then this is the right mobile phone it does not hang and battery lasts almost one and a half days service centers are available in most of the towns spare parts are serviced by microsoft less visits to a service centre considering this i feel it was a right choice after having had some android phones and tablets where the visit to service centre is too often and you are not sure when the mobile would be returned back to you
1775	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	my experience with lumia 730 so far has been good   you wont experience any lag with any heavy games camera is superb  its is selfie phone  but on other side  you will miss apps like quora  gmail and youtube  with windows 10 about to come in month  we may see major changes in phone ui
1776	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	things i want to make clear  1it doesnt have dolby digital sound but it does have something called virtual surroundquite good but no match to dolby as it is one of the best surround system 2throw that dumb earphones in dustbin they provide with this set im using sony mh750 which is available in local stores for 700rs or go for nokia wh208wh308 earphone beware of duplicates while ordering in onlinethe best match for this phone 3no glance screennot at all a problem for me 4previously i was using lumia 620 speakers in this phone are super great when compared to it
1777	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	come on buddys we can get the mob in store itself at 15299 and hw could u charge 1620015800 gear up n lower prices dude
1778	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	better than any other phone in this price range  review  screen oled display rich colour and amazing contrast thanks to the clear black display wide viewing angles and easy to view even in bright sunlight the automatic brightness adjustment feature could have been better since i have use a lumia 620 and the feature just felt better in it there are no keys in the front and thats a really good experience  camera frontcam its a 5mp wideangle cam perfect for people who take selfies and groupies rearcam i know it says 67mp but its a 34zeiss34 large sensor and good apertureproduces amazing pictures in daytime a bit grainy images in the night but manageable  speakers main speaker is really loud and clearbut i feel the could have done better job with the front speaker used while talking lacks a little claritydecent enough though they should have included a camera button  design phone looks stunning with a back cover nokia could have done better on the back front part looks really nice since there are no hard keysvery elegant  operating system i am a windows maniac so obviously will be bent towards the pros it doesnt lag or crash like android if you are looking for a toy and not a smartphone then maybe windows isnt for youwindows10 will be releasing sooni have used the preview and its absolutely amazing  performance fast and reliable battery comes for more than a day on 3g and wifiheats up only after 2hrs of nonstop fifagame  apps all basic apps are present but updates arent as frequent compared to android or ios if you are a guy who plays 34clash of clans34stay awaygiven not all apps are available but after watching microsofts 34build conference34 2015 i am confident that problem will be taken care of  lastly if you want 34class34 blindly go for this phone only disappointment its a 34nokia34 lumia and not a 34microsoft34 lumia some would argue it was better when it was nokia though
1779	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	it is what i would call a total value for money phone its quite handy light weight and sufficiently big though i would have loved a little bigger screen 534 and 1920×1080 display i got the phone within the committed time period from amazon and the packing was good  pros good build quality amazing cameras creative ui from windows light weight wonderful maps comes with required apps just need to update once after opening the box  cons all the apps may not be available as developers are not giving proper attention to windows platform as yet i havent come across any other cons at this point yet  i bought the phone just because i liked the build qualityform factorwindows ui and i was really worried how i was going to migrate my contacts etc from my old phone however the preinstalled 34transfer my data34 app did the job for me using bluetooth in all i really love the phone on second day of my ownership  i feel the preinstalled apps are good enough i am not counting office apps here as i dont have much use for the same to get the most out of a smartphone i really like the entire package ie price pointbuild quality of the phonewindows platform
1780	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	giving it 45 stars this review is based on 3 days of use of this mobile what i liked screen bright thumbs up for clarity operation yes it is buttery smooth touchscreen is perfect look unique i bought a green one white will look good too fits in hand sleekbold contrasting windows 81 is way improved with lots of features added this makes it a good competitor in android market camera oh what do i say abt this camera is the usp of this handset user interface is great other features like loud speaker light weight many unique inbuilt features are just value added to this set  what more do i expect what i did not like 1variety of apps on windows store is limited so do not expect all sorts of apps there though all important and basic apps are available expect microsoft to look at this 2 the battery back up could have been more mine gets drained in 1 and 12 days with moderate use 3 mobile gets little warm while charging may not happen with all units  bottom line if this mobile is one of your choices u can certainly bank on it it will not disappoint you believe me suggestions after you have added this to your cart also buy a class 10 memory card and a good pair of earphones i dont know when will nokia start giving good quality earphones d
1781	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	so much rocking phone 62you dont even need to click any button to attend the phone calls simply raise windows phone to ear call is attended automatically with the help of app called  34gestures beta34 with some more features in windows store just install it from windows store and youre done 62lumia camera greatest thing ever with 3200 iso and 4 sec capturing pictures gives so much clear and bright image during night 62lumia selfie  captures selfie itself with back camera as well 62cortana in lumia answers all your spoken questions 6262here drive  very best of lumia mixradio is far better than music playeryou can download songs at lightning speed less than half second per song with 3g and takes 4 seconds for a full profile great ms officeyou know its free 62 30 gb cloud storage with internet 6234photosynth34 very great for 3d picture wether up or down front or back so many more like video tuner vocal camera zinio zomato
1782	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	my main requirements when i was buying a new phone were a budget phone with a great battery life and a good camera two of my friends are already using this phone and had given me great reviews so i decided to buy this phone without further thought i usually prefer buying phones from actual stores but given the price difference and the fact that i trust amazon i decided to give it a shot the phone arrived before estimated delivery time and i am in love truthfully this is like the last gift nokia gave it users before closing up  a highend phone disguised as a budget phone the camera is awesome  both front and back plus the photo editors are great i was using pixlr in my previous phone but i dont need it now the sound quality reminds me of the old nokia phones which used to be really nice and loud the battery backup is too good to be true n with all this come the various lumia applications which i am still discovering and loving i had been warned that the app store is very limited but i am not a gaming person so i have found all the apps that i use  except for google chrome but internet explorer is good too this phone can give competition to most high end phones out there my advice is that buy this phone before microsoft realises the pricing mistake p  review update after 1 month of usage 1 month of usage and i am still in love with this phone so its time for a longer review 1 design  47 inches screen fits well in my hand it could have been designed to be smaller without the extra space above and below the screen but never mind the back feels very good and not slippery i am currently using a case so its protected well i have even accidentally dropped it twice or thrice and nothing has happened to it so great 2 battery  i love love love the battery life it lasts for more than a day with my constant usage  the 3g and wifi are always on and i check my mail facebook instagram whatsapp on it n the battery saver mode is very efficient the phone has remained on for more than an hour on 4  6 battery d 3 camera  or rather cameras  both the front and the back camera are awesome and comparable to any high end phone the colors clarity and depth are to die for i keep posting pics and i myself can make out the difference the back camera app  lumia camera has some amazing settings  i have tried different shutter speeds iso focus and it does make a difference plus the pre installed nokia editing apps make the pictures just stand out 4 health  fitness  so before this i was using a separate step tracker and a gps tracker for my cardio and a diet tracker  but u know what all that comes neatly wrapped up microsofts own health  fitness app it works very well too so it tells you the number of steps taken for running you can set it up for distance or time as a goal it has a calorie counter app as well  which doesnt have as much food items as myfitnesspal app but i m sure itll improve with time 5 theres this preinstalled app called mix radio in which u can listen to mixes according to your favourite artists or moods  and these mixes can even be downloaded for offline listening  and the mix gets refreshed every 20 days 6 nokia maps and here drive  are much better than google maps here drive even tells you if youre speeding p 7 the earphones provided with the phone are decent enough 8 app store  is limited so for anyone whos into gaming im not really sure if all of them will be available here common apps like facebook twitter whatsapp instagram medscape are all available though so really i could go on and on praising this phone n u could just keep reading about it or u could just buy it and discover it for yourself 
1783	Nokia Lumia 730 (Dual SIM, Grey)	best phone at this price range  go for it dont look at specifications just feel quality of display smooth performance and zeiss lens are extremely magnificent
1784	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	almost one year and it is still a beast i did not buy this phone on amazon but bought it directly from google in november last year while i was in us since the phone has been with me for about an year now i am tempted to write about how wonderful this phone is  display and body the display has been stunning and it remains so i am not using any screen guard or a case for last several months and there is not even a single scratch on the screen i am not over protecting so i can vouch for the screen quality the back of the phone does have some signs of wear but that is bound to happen to a white phone with no case still it doesnt look like its been used for an year my samsungs got really ugly within 34 months only  performance i have used samsung galaxy note 1 note 2 and htc one and other than htc all samsungs would get slow over time i have had to reset the phones every few months to recover some of the performance back with nexus 5 it has been performing exceedingly well and i havent reset it yet the snapdragon 800 processor is still one of best out there i did have to reboot the phone a couple of times when the phone kind of hung but that looked more like a third party app issue  battery this is the weakest point of the phone but is still good for a day of heavy usage after 1 year of heavy use i have noticed marginal decrease in the battery capacity about 10 i would say with a moderate usage the phone can last for 1 and a half day easily which is what most smartphones would last anyway since i always have access to some sort of charging facility the battery has never been an issue for me but could be for others  people have already said a lot of this phone so i wont add any further all i would say is that if you really want to spend more than 20k on a smartphone then dont even look at any of the micromaxkarbonnlenovo etc just go for it you would love it for sure
1785	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	worst packaging i have ever seen gabbar deals sent the 28000 rs phone like a pack of socks the package was not properly sealed it was soaking wet due to rains no shock protection in fact no protection at all just a crappy soaking cardboard box i can share the pics of the received package thankfully the phone was not damaged or maybe it wasnt looking damaged very disappointed with the packaging but very satisfied with the phone
1786	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	my nexus 5 stroy  placed the order 62 excitement 62 parcel arrived 62 used for a day 62 defect detected 62 package sent back to amazon  this screen come every time i shiftmove from one page to another
1787	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	my review comes exactly after 15 days of using this phone its a monster phone the stock 442 kitkat with no extra apps ensure you get a lagfree experience the 23g qcore processor makes it racy as hell any game  app you wanna installyou got it over the days ive noticed that it gives me almost 6065 ram free meaning multitasking is a breeze those who think camera isnt great well get yourself a digicamera and stop whining on websites minus points low speaker volume plasticky keys average camera nonexpandable memory  buy this phone and one would never regret about it
1788	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	hi folks i have migrated to nexus 5 from galaxy note n7000 which was getting slower by the day before i made the purchase i went to many electronic stores and tried out samsung s5 note 3 and sony z1 for hours sadly i didnt find nexus 5 on display anywhere forcing me to rely on the reviews and feedback available on the net from what i read everywhere i felt compelled to go for nexus 5 and this is all i have to say  8226it is sleek lightweight and beautiful 8226it is blazing fast 8226it is as good as samsung s5 note 3 if not better for 60 of the cost and it is definitely better than sony z1 8226it being an official google device it will get priority updates for the next 18 months 8226it has no bloatware like samsung etc google now works like a charm  cons you dont get to insert a memory card or change the battery suits me fine i dont believe in cramming in every known bit on earth in my phones memory 8212ive hardly ever exceeded 8 gb till now as for the battery i am changing my phone every two years anyway camera go get a dslr if you are serious about photography  so go ahead pull a nexus 5 off the shelf right away you wont get a better phone today

1793	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	i am not writing about the phone specification or the 400 ppi screen which you all must be aware after using the phone for over two weeks now i feel its a great device for the price that it is offering pros  cons 1 its fast as fast as the iphone 5s its faster than the note 3 that is having 3 gb ram 2 camera if you read any other review on that phone they speak that the camera is below par yea it takes more time to open that camera auto focus is also difficult to controllow light snaps are below average camera i will say is as good as any other camera unless its compared to the mighty lumia 1020 and xperia z1 3 battery its another area of concern it lasts average 12 hrs on regular usage a mix of browsing camera games and videos but on heavy usage it drops below 8 hrs but it is still good enough to pull for a day 4 google now its much more deeply integrated in kitkat its much more in practical  on giving recommendation cards based on your likes web history and location and other updates 5 size and form factor its very light weight weighting at 130gm its just 12 gm heavier than i phone 5s its very thin and sturdy the back panel will offer you enough grip much better than the back panels of s4 even on the pocketablity side it fits in to the shirt pockets very easily and pocket wont be sagging down white version is slippery on holding watch out  its a value for money offering i think its the best nexus phone ever
1794	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	i bought the nexus 5 to replace my note 2  first impression the phone is lightweight and feels very comfortable in the hand i feel that the 495 inch screen is the perfect balance between screen size and portability  pros 1 the phone is buttery smooth and can easily match the iphone 5s in this category running android 442 kitkat out of the box it feels intuitive and easy to navigate and doesnt slow down even while multitasking 2 gamers will get great mileage out of this asphalt 8 runs like a dream on the highest settings 3 the google now integration is fantastic right from reminders to cricket updates and the latest news its like having a personal assistant that understands your needs and gives you relevant information 4 like all google supported phones you get updates first and dont have to wait for months like you would with samsung or htc  cons 1 the battery life is still on the lower side compared to some other phones but the battery drain bug should be fixed in 443 so it may be a non issue expect around 1014 hrs on moderate use with 3g with around 4 hrs screen on time 2 camera is decent nothing extraordinary but will fulfill your day to day requirements just fine day shots look great with hdr and night shots are ok with flash on bit disappointed that there is no stock option for slow motion video recording like the note 2 had 3 dont expect fantastic speaker sound use headphones and you should be fine  verdict if you are looking for topend phone that isnt ridiculously priced this will exceed your expectations
1795	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	after a week small but visible scratches appeared on the bottom of the screensince nexus 5 is made of gorilla glass 3 it should not be happenedi have done nothing that can explain such a scratch
1796	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	i had bought this phone having faith and trust in the brand google but i feel cheated when the screen of this device is breaking again and againthe screen is so brittle that even if anything touch the screen it cracks i had replaced it once which was an expensive exertion but again after 1 month it cracked the phone is for 28k and the screen for 7k which equal to a phone in the marketi cannot keep on spending my money this way for the protection of the screen i had added the screen guard and the body cover but still cracked i dont suggest anyone to buy this brittle piece
1797	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	i feel liberated and pleased the best phone i have had so far i could not ask for anything better
1798	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	i ordered nexus 5 device from amazonin with ezeekart retailer this is the first time i ordered something from amazonin and considering the biggest online market in india i was pretty confident that product i ordered would have no complaints  device i received has several defects  1 camera has yellowish tint hence pictures are not clear 2 whenever i open camera app i get message about total data and talktime balance available from my serivce provider which is weird 3 led notification light with my device not working  i am surprised that when i got the device delivered and checked the receipt by seller there is no contact information with the seller  worst first experience amazon
1799	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	its my 2nd nexus 5 phone why i have purchased it 2nd time is its overall quality system updates are fast you dont have to wait for it like other smartphones thats why your phone will be ahead of others performance wise this phone is satisfactory to me it crashed several times but i have installed heavy games on this like fifa asphalt etc look wise it just awesome attractive phone its price is now almost 20k so its worth to buy overall built quality is good i sped too much time to search another phone within 25k but i didnt find the right product
1800	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	great phone i got it in 27k really worth in this price its very light very handy from usability perspective processing speed is very gooddoesnt get hang at all only two issues i have noticed  the 1st one is that the battery gets discharged bit too quickly if you use it very much like watching videos playing games etc and the other one is it gets bit heated up but again this is only when you use it very extensively like playing high quality games etc but as per my daily outside usability perspective i am not finding myself in problem because of these two issues because i normally dont like to play much of games or video when i am outside and so i am easily getting around 24hrs of battery backup which is not bad at all and its not getting much heated up also so overall its really nice to have this phone
1801	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	nice and attractive looking phone light weight rubber grip makes it awesome to hold fast and works crisp  pros  light weight large clear screen  no screen guard required camera quality good for both front and backback specially in case of zero light rubber grip does not feel plastic like most phone fast and smooth supports lte band  cons  speaker quality below average heats up a bit on using lot on wifi battery life ok for normal day to day use
1802	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	i purchased nexus 5 after researching for a while performance is awesomemy only little con is the battery backuphowever it does not bother me much   battery stays for a day after continuous usage happy with the purchase   after lollipop upgrade there were few performance issues with camera and response time while contact lookup hope google will release the bug fix updates soon  amazon product deliver was perfect and price is less comparable to other ecommerce giants 
1803	Google Nexus 5 D821 (16GB, Black)	nexus 5 is the best android phonebut on kitkat 444lollipop is the worst thing that happened to nexus 5so if anyone buys a nexus 5 do not uodate it to android 50 lollipop overall its a very good phoneits fast and performance is goodi have been using it for 8 monthstill now there have been no issuesand the phone has only one con that its battery life is very averagewill just last 10 hours or so but the phone is value for money as one can enjoy all the google services
1804	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	i have been using this phone for 3 months now and yes i also faced the same problems like heating and after lollipop some new problems so here is what i did 1 for screen blank on incoming or outgoing calls you have to calibrate the proximity sensor anf for that dial 7769 and then tap calibrate and follow onscreen instruction it will calibrate the sensor here is some guide for some noobs who does not understand a bit technical after dialing the number given above it will ask you bring your finger near the sensor and then move away only twicethough you can do as much as you want and it will calibrate the sensor below will be written good on the screen you can exit after that  2 for the heating issue heating while gaming is normal because the phone has good gpugraphics processing unit so no problem there but if your phone is like heated all the time then here is what i did i got my phone rooted then removed the unnecessary bloatwares preinstalled unnecessary apps from google and then install greenify app from playstore this app will help keep your phone cool and will also increase the battery backup and one more thing dont keep unnecessary apps in your phone uninstall what you does not use my phone runs totally cool caution if you are not a geeky mind and are not aware of little technical things like rooting and stuff then proceed with caution though you can find several videos on youtube for rooting your phone but dont follow anyone blindly follow xda developers website and their methods instead i soft bricked my device when i was trying to root my phone after the lollipop update  3 heating issue after lollipop update for this problem you will have to delete the cache partition of the phone after the lollipop update once your phone is rebooted after the update you have to boot it into recovery to boot into recovery shut down your phone once it is off press power button  volume upvolume down button altogether it will boot your phone into recovery then choose delete cache partition it will remove the data on the internal storage  then reboot and it will take little long for reboot but after that your phone will run cool and smooth you can also go for factory reset after this process is complete by going again into recovery and then choose factory reset it will be mush better to do so but just remember that factory reset will wipe all your data in the internal storage but not of the sd card  4 buy a sd card and just dont keep the phones memory full after lollipop update you can move your apps to the sd card it is also helpfull  thats all folks hope this proves helpful here is my personal complaint to the manufacturere of this phone they should have mentioned that yureka is developers phone and could not be handled by a normal user so that people could think before buying this phone   thank you for your precious time
1805	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	first of all stop complaining and posting negative reviews you people dont deserve a phone some are not verified as amazon purchaser and commenting here can be deemed as haters this phone is featured packedfirst of all many say its a rebranded chinese phone coolpad or something with better specs using this for a month nowhowever i cant guarantee of its durability and longevity unless i use it for atleast 6 monthslollipop update isnt stable but in kitkat it was super fluid  pros qualcomm snapdragon 615 64 bit processor and octacore cpu and adreno 405 gpu which is great for multitasking where i keep 10 to 15 apps in background and 15 tabs open in chrome browser i generally playsan andreas and fifa 15 in medium or bit above settings smooth enough 2 gb ram 55 in hd display great for watching and playing games and browsing good camera 13 mp rear is good i will attach my screenshots with this reviewi feel the camera algorithm or software makes it bit worse for my likingi can manage to manual focus objects a lot closer like 1 inch distancewhich is really really nice for a phone camera in low light photos arent good and in flash its even worse a yellow tint and the image composition is lostfull hd videos are very nicei do manual focus a lot and it feels very good when it locks on that subject quite nice i would say in well lit conditions but bad in low lightthe images of front 5 mp camera is okay i would say the images i will post here are taken in 13 mp resolution and some are taken with hdr on where it produces good colours to its otherwise slightly faded imagesi have edited almost all pics by cropping in 169 aspect ratio and added few filters using snapseed backlit capactive buttons  cons battery backup is okayishi am a power user  i get alteast 45 hrs screen on timealways wifi on but no mobile data chrome browser open and gaminggaming drains your battery really fast like within 2 hrsi play gta san andreas thoughwhich is both gpu and cpu extensiveso may be a bit of stress on the phone  medium users like 10 hrs above light users or those sometimes or less indulging in whatsapp and messenger wud get 1820 hrs or full day phone gets heated up when stressing chipset or playing games build quality is decent but a bit fragile 
1806	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	truly an octa core beast works flawlessly amazingly fast cyanogenmod rocks and at this price the cons can easily be neglected pros well all people know the phone is awesome too much to write here like camera is awesome cm theme engine is even more awesome screen is also quite decent viewing angles are also not bad touch response is amazing front cam is also good and features like double tap to wake sleep etc works flawlessly cons no major issues but minor problems like heating wifi takes few seconds to connect and average battery backup nowplease read carefully  the moment i upgraded to cm12 ie lollipop issues like contacts dialer stopped lagginess then proximity sensor issue screen blank issue etc came up but now we all know cm11ie kitkat was 32 bit and cm12lollipop is 64 bit so its mainly due to compatibility issue    i searched yu forums and they told me to just take a backup factory reset the phone go to the recovery menu by pressing powervolume upvol down together while the phone is off and clear the cache partition and believe me after clearing cache partition from recovery and factory resetting all the problems were gone now the phone works like a charm so please dont bother about those 1star reviews and people complaining about these things ps those people who are giving 1 star reviews or are applying for refunds for problems like screen going blank etc the yureka is not their cup of tea they are ultimate noobs as they cant solve these minor problems by themselves as these problems can easily be solved by even an 8 year old child if they are taught how to they should rather waste their money on samsung  htc sony etc and get substandard hardware and software both even at the double price i mean this is cyanogenmod not the plain old and boring stock android this might contain bugs so what they will fix all of them in the future updates  you wont get a fix like this in samsung phones they dont even bother to give updates for phones priced below 20k and thanks for reading this long review
1807	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	all people are mad over heredont listen to those reviewsu might not get everything in 6210ku cannot get everything in the desired rangeu have to compromise for atleast something be contended with what you havedont write negative reviewsi suggest others to not read thatsome people are saying that 34not quality phone34 who told u to buy this it was ur opinion it was clearly said 34yu yureka34 not 34samsung34 samsung can give these features in 15000 but they cant give features like cyanogen or oxygen os
1808	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	yureka rocks  got the little monster in 2 days thanks for amazon as always super fast delivery and now directly jumping to yureka review   i have zenfone 5 and redmi note  i received yureka with kitkat and immediately upgraded to lollypop and woah cool new features and awesome phone with so many spec at such a low pricei will not go in detail about spec since now everyone in the world knows that  now after upgrading i immediately unlocked the bootloader installed cwm and did root removed system apps and blah blah blahall geeks knows that  now after doing all this i am not seeing a single issue which other users are telling and giving 1 to this little monsterfor me battery backup is more than a day for normal to heavy usage using dual sim with wifi and 810 callsno screen blank and no heating issue  so guys just go onand buy this small monster and u will never regreti will update review after 1 months of usage again
1809	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	you can definitely go for yureka if you live in cold places like antartica because it works flawlessly as  room heater  even the most costliest  room heaters cant beat it you can invest on yureka instead of a room heater good news is that this even works on battery once charged fully it gives backup for 3 hours max if you update it to lollipop things get even better  it heats more quickly  but battery life is reduced to 2 hours it should be listed in room  heaters section amazon by mistake listed it in mobiles section i hope they will correct it soon worst after sales service source i used it for 75 days its almost summer so stopped using it will start using it again in winter
1810	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	i had received faulty moto e handset earlieri sold it on olx n ordered this handset on brothers recommendation n also had read review articlesndtv on this device n it was rated good everywhere except amazonmay b fake usersoverall i feel satisfied with this phone  cons  after lollipop update battery drains down faster  call screen turning off even after frequent caliberation  gaming experience wasnt smoothestnot even like moto e  hopethere will b update for sorting out these issues
1811	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	yureka is best phone in this price range around 9k slight heating and battery probs are there but i havent still updated to lollipop i will upadte shortly and lets hope for the best
1812	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	i had got my phone 2 days back i am not a heavy user of a phone dont even use watsapp  fb regularly or keep mobile data on but my battery drains in 45 hours it gets charged 13 an hour  slowest speed  even spice has better speed y i am saying 1 hr coz after that the charger overheats too the phone is normally hot and superhot near top it shows 12c higher than room temp if room temp is 2627c phone battery shows above 40c  pros good features 55 inch display good camera good price  cons super over heating battery draining in 45 hr in idle mode in normal way with internet 2 a minute cant use any of the good features bcoz of no battery doesnt get charged fast voice is not that good  i bought it after reviewing similar reviews i took a chance coz no other phone has such features in such price but i forgot most essential thing  how i m going to use those features if there is no battery  yu should seriously not waste time if they cant make standard quality i am now phoneless by the time i geta new one also lost 300 bucks  for fast delivery and tempered glass  i purchased
1813	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	its a decent product yeah i agree that every phone has a good as well as bad point outs  therefore heres some of pros and cons of this phone pros » amazing display full hd ips 55 having no trouble to use while travelling at day light  »headphone sounds too good because it has provided with an audio fx softwarefrom whre u cn adjust according to ur needs » with having 2gb ddr3 ram this phn doesnt hangs even multitasking i can open many tabs and many apps and minimise easily and switch to the other ones without any jam »awesome camera qualityboth  front and back video quality is hd thus just what u have to do is focus it by tapping on the screen  and enjoy the mini dslr camera featuring zeus phone  » i m playing asphalt 8 airbornerobocop fifa 15 and so other without any hanging  because of its graphics adreno 405  snapdragon 615 » running on cyanogen 11  android 444 update is available  but m happy with this os  » having storage user memory about  128gb is enough to store music videosand much moreprovided 16 gb internal » battery backup is good but if u r a gamer then it will depends upon u   cons »only one cons is for me is it gets little bit heated while gaming  it is obviously a normal issue because ithas gpu 405 and thus  providing u a good service while playing games
1814	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	well i didnt update after reading the reviews so cant comment on lollipop but glad i had the courage to buy this well im a geek with htc explorer rooted cyanogened and did all other buggiest things in my phony  since i now work a busy jobi didnt want to mess with buggy things anymore but did buy this anyway 1 no proximity issue for me 2 no heating issue and compared to moto g2 this is nothing and no  cant use it as an iron box or heater seems paid reviewers or maybe lollipop users 3 graphics are totally cool gta vice city played with full graphics settings without a lag one of the important factor i bought this  graphics for my studies 4 front camera takes cool pictures in stock camera app 5 all cyanogen features 6 using inbuilt privacy guardwhich i adore  i disabled all 34keep awake34 from google apps saves some battery 7 30000 on the antutu beating htc one 1 camera 13mp is weak no optical stabilisation  image looks blurred grainy if i change settings to 5mp in 34open camera34it looks bearable flash gives that bluish tinge the glassor sticker covering the camera is a little blue with the flash so close to the camera maybe thats why  not in the mood to rip up the hardware  im not a photographer to begin with so its pretty much okay for me 37 second video recording  costs 89 mb  quality okay 2 for my usescreen on 4 hours browsing to intensive gpu  battery drains 100 to 40 in 9 to 5 pm 3 no apps to sd 4 no obb to sd androiddata stays in internal memory 5 one more smartphone of my life without a compass  all in all glad i bought and thank my god for giving me this ps use a professional to use paste that screen guard seriously ive been trying to do this like forever with different phones and still bubbles
1815	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	have extensively used yureka so here are the points all in all it is best device if you dont expect it to be handy with many themes change and preloaded applications with satisfactory rear 13mp camera it provides super fast processing with octa core processor 2gb ram and provides 12 gb internal user stotage which is extensible  1 rear camera quality is not as good as 13 mp face detection auto focus gps works fine but image is not perfectly filled with pixels 2 no autofocus in front camera still it is very good 3 most of the customization options are there is cyogen os expect themes 4 12 gb internal memory for users is a plus with 2 gb ram 5 limited scope with loud speakers sound is not clear on full volume but everything is perfect with headfones 6 reverse usb tethering is not possible only way to use pcs lan is to use lan as wifi use mhotspot for windows other option to do reverse usb tethering is to root the device 7 graphs does not develop correctly in calculator application 8 processing is super fast with octacore processor but some application like dashlane slows up page load menu or front page its because this app scans every page to verify if it some sort of login page on andriod 9  battery works awesome device warms up very less as compared to other devices like red mi even when wifi is used continuously 10 some cool applications are not pre reloaded in it which are in red mi 2 like compass and coordinates app
1816	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	after more expectations finally i got yureka its really good phone very good process and also everything is ok the only problem is heating i bought this mobile on monday with kitkat 44 with this version mobile gets over heating low volume problems are found so i thought to go for lollipop bt most people posted bad reviews about lollipop in yureka bt also i upgraded some problems found proximity sensor nt working then i calibrated using the following code 7769 after calibrated sensor working fine ringer volume sligtly iacutencreased in lollipop still heating problem hanging problems are found so i am serching for solution i found the sol i did wipe cache partician after that mobile heat reduced to 50 per hang problem not found now overall mobile is ok only drawback is chargiacuteng time is increased when comparing with kitkat and minor heating while charging and playing games over all the product is good better choice at this price of range thaks
1817	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	its awesome phone  i found no recognizable flaws  i gave 4 stars bcz it take 1015min extra after reaching 99 to get 100 battery and pics taken from stock cam app gives noisy pics if the phone shake a bit i get almost 2024hrs battery backup max with 68 hrs sot no lag no heating  no other bugs i recommend this to all
1818	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	this is my review on yu yureka after using the mobile for 2 months  pros 10004price of the phone 10004build quality is awesome 10004performance is great dont worry that phone will get hanged doing multi tasks 10004cyanogen os 11 comes with load of features 10004march 26 2015 onwards yureka going to get lollipop update 10004the front camera is 5 mp is very well suited for selfies  can produce a decent picture quality in back camera 13mp too  cons minor issues like 10008proximity sensor 10008over heating 10008low light photography but this problems can be sorted by upcoming future software update  conclusion  overall a good phone at this price which can be compared with high ends phone in market 100 recommended just go for it
1819	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	you should rename yourself as yuplaydead  i was super excited on purchasing the yureka yu from amazon on the 6th may 2015  i had a micromax canvas 2 plus and was impressed by the quality plus i am a swadeshi advocate all this lead me to purchase the yu yureka  i was super happy i recd it in record time ie on saturday 9 may 2015 evening 6 pm itself  all my excitement started dying away when i understood that there was a problem with my piece  whenever i receive  make a call on my phone my voice is completely inaudible to the individual at the other end i have to use the provided headset for my voice to be heard  i started complaining this to your toll free number immediately from 715 pm on 9 may 2015 from another number  8380091149 check if you must  minimum 15 calls and 2 forum posts later the problem still persists  following are the chronological way of suggestions i recd from your call centre  1 factory restart the phone with the headphones plugged in 9 may 2015  didnt work  2 reboot the phone with the headphones plugged in 11 may 2015  didnt work  3 switch off and switch on the phone without the headphones plugged in 11 may 2015  didnt work  4 factory restart without the headphones plugged in 11 may 2015  didnt work    i demand a brand new piece as replacement or a visit by your engineer to solve this issue at my doorstep  note  i dont want a refurbished phone i want a brand new one or this very piece repaired at my doorstep    also have the decency to not hang up the call from your end when a customer is speaking to you  
1820	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	using this phone from last more than 3 months amazing phone no lagging awesome performance issue are only two with this phone 1 less battery backup 2 camera quality is not as much good  apart from these factors phone is superb  having no comparison in indian market with this build features  quality

1822	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	supppperrrrrrb mobile i have ever used there is no heating issue before and after update people you should know how to use it every device heats if simultaneously and continuously apps are running in background stop those background apps and enjoy this beast i had some issues regarding otg but it is solved after lollipop upgrade
1823	YU Yureka (Moondust Grey)	i dont need to give a detailed specification of this product as you know it already but regarding the problems other users are complaining about its just that they dont know hot to solve these problems this is a custom rom and little technical knowledge is required or you can simply google it for solving out the problems faced like screen going black during calls heating problems etc for heating issue hard reset the phone you can google how to hard resetafter updating to lollipop for screen going blank issue you must try the solution given in earlier comments by caliberating proximity sensoror you can google it you can root it customise it and dont have to worry about warranty so a great buy in budget mobiles

1844	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	i bought this phone a month ago from amazon firstly kudos to amazon for delivering on time    coming to the phone its excellent the battery on the 638 lasts almost as long as my old lenovo p770 which came with a mammoth 3500 mah battery the voice quality is the best i have ever seen crystal clear the touch is responsive although i wish there was a setting like on ms windows mouse controls which would make the scrolling become more faster    the 1 gb ram ensures that the phone works flawlessly even when multitasking it doesnt hang hardly once and that was just the gmail app the rest of the phone was responding i have already dropped the phone 34 times and the screen looks like it can take a lot more abuse    for 7000 bucks i think this is the best phone out there if you dont want a zillion apps on your phone even in my android i just had a few apps gmail facebook whatsapp naukricom and a few others all of which are available on windows    the best thing i like is i dont have to download any apps to clear ram boost memory boost speed clear up cache and god knows what else the phone does all that reminds me of my good old symbian nokia e5    not having flash is a little bit of an issue i use it to go to the washroom at night or in a movie hall to walk down the stairs but apart from that one aspect i did not find it lacking for anything    excellent phone an absolutely pleasure to use
1845	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	i just love it meet my needs no lags superfast affordable 4g phone  first of all am a lumia boy 620830630 nd now 638 i just low lumia and its user interface compared to android coming to lumia 638 its just a masterpiece in middle end devices 1gb ram with snapdragon 400 makes it superfast sound clarity is good but not that much of 630 camera is good the only negative we can say is that there is no flash for the rear camera and there is no front cam otherwise this will be super affordable most fav phone for many  regarding delivery what to say  it was just excellent ordered around 6pm in the evening got it delivered on next day morning around 9am delivered in less than 15 hours  in normal free delivery option  coming to software section microsoft india has not given lumia denim to 638 and says that it will be directly updated to windows 10 the current software in 638 is cyan release wp81 if any body needs denim release wp81 update 1 just follow these steps theres an easy way to get it through preview for developers pfd update just follow these steps go to this page nd register for free app studio account  httpappstudiowindowscomenus the email used to register should be same as of the microsoft account email in your device after completing the registration download an app to the mobile from store  preview for developers app httpswwwwindowsphonecomeninstoreapppreviewfordevelopers178ac8a165194a0b960c038393741e96signintrue then go to the app and again sign in with the same ms account enable preview for developers done now settings 62 phone update 62 check for updates you will get an update and you will be updated to build 14147 after updating again check for updates will get another update nd your phone will be update to build 14219 ie lumia denim wp81 update 1 os version 81014219341 cortana is now enabled in your 638  this way you can get denim in 638 or if you dont need new features and are satisfied with cyan you can wait till windows 10 gets released lumia 638 in cv will directly get updated to 10 without denim
1846	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	nokia lumia will not have denim update in india  if it doesnt have denim update then it will not support next version ie 10 amazon know this and kept quiet to make profit  refer below twitter comment from microsoft  httpstwittercommicrosoftindiastatus588227992456953858
1847	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	it is an awesome device for those who are network buffs and those like me who gives preference to network and speed rather than anything elseits voice quality is very good call handling is excellentcamera is very very impressive even without a flashthose of you who needs a camera may go for lumia 535 this model lumia 638 is a single sim mobile which is good for 4g network and it has 1gb of ram to cater to the needs of gamers and application users which is more than required for the intended purpose screen is awesome too video handling is also fine can play 720p videos easilyscreen resolution is also fine and have deep color depths with black screenbattery lasts for a full day in office use with normal calls and internet usagespeaker is loud enough but one difference i noted i would like to share with you readers i have upgraded lumia 630 dual sim to lumia 638 the sound quality of lumia 630 was way better in terms of quality it had deep notes and beautifully handles low notes very wellalthough both the mobiles are identical but 630 was made in vieatnam and was of superior quality than 638 which is made in china the difference is obvious in call quality as welloverall the quality of hardware used by lumia is very good quality compared to its competitors i would recommend this to those who have zest for internet speed and can do without a flash camera without a front facing camera of courseskypee calls are however good but one has to twist it backwardsapplications are managed very good however not as ripe as android but it still in improvement and frequently updated overall a good move by nokiamicrosoft
1848	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	the last warrior from nokia brand lumia 638 does everything you expect from a nokia device pros 1with that 1gb ram its just not a smooth device but also makes sure it will be updates to windows10 the lumia730 and lumia830 also have same ram and same snapdragon400 chipset 2 it is very lite on hand and easy to use with single hands 3 5mp camera comes with manual controls on iso focus appeture value and exposure value 4 battery life moderate usage ensure more then 1 and a half day of usage 5 comes in with gorilla glass3 and back panel is like a back cover to the phone 6 i got it for 4799 under whatte deal offer but even for its current price of 6799 its an awesome device 7 all android apps that run smooth on android devices of similar specs are available for this device as well 8 all apps movable to mmc  cons 1 no flash light 2 no snapchat app 3 brightness has to be adjusted manually 4 atleast vga front camera should have been provided having said that given the small and easy to handle size of device u can still click selfie by using back camera
1849	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	one of the best phones from nokia good for gaming and surfinglacks front camerahow many of us chat using front camera  i think rarelyn u have the option to use back cam alwayslumia n microsoft apps are awesomewindows phones are virus protectedno need to use any antivirusdownload nokia maps and use gps without internet i recommend to use lumiabelieve me internet on vodaphone 3g is lighting fastgood job lumia and microsoft
1850	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	the nokia lumia 638 midrange smartphone that was launched in chinanotably this smartphone is the first one to support 4g lte in the lumia lineup launched in india and it will be available exclusively via amazon and microsoft brand store those interested in this smarphone can check out the quick review of it based on its hardware aspects  camera and internal storage nokia is offering a 5 mp auto focus rear shooter with support for panorama shooting mode notably when the entry level and midrange market is obsessed with selfie focused smartphones this one lacks a front facer that is a major downside also the rear snapper is not backed by support for led flash for better low light performance imaging wise the handset way too dated for its pricing and cannot be comparable to its rivals in this segment internal storage is standard at 8 gb and there is support for expandable storage space up to 128 gb using a micro sd card slot onboard also as the device runs on windows phone 81 it gets free 15 gb of onedrive cloud storage support  processor and battery lumia 638 employs a 12 ghz quad core qualcomm snapdragon 400 processor aided by 1 gb ram we have seen this hardware combination in many other smartphones in the midrange segment and it is known for its performance that will cater to the moderate users without any clutter or lag battery capacity is 1830 mah and though the exact backup rendered by this unit is not disclosed we believe that it should let the phone last for decent hours under moderate usage  display and features lumia 638 makes use of a clearblack lcd display measuring 45 inches that will eliminate reflections as it employs a sequence of polarizing layers this display carries a fwvga screen resolution of 854×480 pixels that translates to a pixel density of 221 pixels per inch with an average pixel count this screen should be capable of handling the basic tasks that are expected from a smartphone of its pricing at ease  software running on the nokia offering is latest windows phone 81 os with lumia denim update also the smartphone arrives preloaded with microsoft enterprise feature pack microsoft office onedrive here maps and drive connectivity aspects of the lumia 638 include 4g lte 3g wifi bluetooth gps and dual sim functionality furthermore airtel is providing free 5 gb of 4g data for 2 months for postpaid subscribers in bengaluru till march 31 2015  what we like support for 4g lte connectivity competitive pricing  what we dislike no rear flash and lack of front facing camera  price and conclusion the nokia lumia 638 priced at rs 8299 is definitely a pocket friendly phone with a reasonable pricing the device takes advantage of 4g lte connectivity that is hardly a part of the entry level and mid range offerings however while the indian and chinese brands have dominated the market with their solid devices the lumia 638 comes with pretty average specifications and lags behind its challengers in terms of photography if the imaging department is definitely not your first preference you can opt for the nokia smartphone for its super fast connectivity support
1851	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	this is the cheapest 4g mobile in india even before the technology implemented through the country looks and features are similar to lumia 630 added feature is 1gb ram with clock speed of 12ghz quad core it is definitely buttery smooth performance guaranteed few things need to be considered before buying ie no flash no front camera for video call or selfie no corning gorilla glass these are done for cost cutting if these are featured in this definitely this is gonna be a best buy and it will last long with the user till 4g becomes popular in india
1852	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	i absolutely love this phone i used lumia 510 625 720 so i feel this has a premium touch regarding its style flash would had been a plus if it was there but images which i captures in low light also has good quality compared to other phones in the same range even the selfie was good the pics was without shake or noise no over saturation in colour photo lumia apps are great battery is a bummer in my place with irregular network coverage it hardly lasts 89 hours for net browsing on ehh battery should have been at least 1900mah or 200mah since this phone is basically designed for net surfing the apps had to be moved to sd card as it fills up internal memory pretty fast but after that there were no problems the home back and search buttons should have been hardware instead of software when they decided to use these buttons as software they should have atleast used up the space at the bottom for extra screen space it confuses a lit bit at first for my small hands the screen is perfect has clarity even at sunlight except when i covered it with matte screen guard there is no corning gorilla glass protection but phone seems sturdy enough to take sufficient beatings calls are very clear speakers are very good not the same about the headphones which comes with the set there is no data cable in the box charger is pretty fast though i am not a gamer playing some games like temple run 2 subway surfers my experience was pleasing dont know about high end games overall this phone has an excellent config for a low cost mobile i am happy with its experience until now i would definitely recommend this  hi again  i would like to update my review because i said the headphones ouput was average but when i connected to my 21 speakers it had an excellent output enjoyed hours of music
1853	Nokia Lumia 638 (Black)	i bought lumia in february the phone worked fine till last saturday let me brief my experience with it it is a good deal for 7000 it can run all graphic demanding games easily the captured image quality is better than those phones in the similar price range no hangs and device performs really well now the downside some lumia devices are having qhsusb issues that is device cannot read os from memory hence it cannot start  and even resetmanual will not work in other words the phone is dead this happens when a update fails to install properly but in my case the battery got down to 0 and when  charged back i realized this problem windows has a recovery tool to help with this issue but it cannot repair all devices it can repair only dload errors my device was not repaired by that tool you can search for these problems on windows forum and sometimes you have to reset your phone after battery goes to zero and the irony is that people at service center dont have any idea about these issues and they will send your device to companythey said to me to resolve the issue it takes 1520 days i left my device at service center yesterday and they asked me to come after 20 days it may not happen with every device but i witnessed a lot of lumias with these problems

1874	HTC Desire 820s (Milkyway Gray)	the design and amazons delivery is excellent both front  back camera is fine little bit heating problem battery backup is too worse data cable is too short 2gb ram is of no use we cant see speed in any application there is no upgrade of android lollipop os price is high compare to configuration the front speakers are good but not louder the 55 screen is fine however there is no image quality because of low pixels the ear phones are not satisfactory finally it will satisfy 50 of your expectations

1876	HTC Desire 820s (Milkyway Gray)	camera of the phone is not good as compared to other phones in this budget i have been using this phone from past two weeks and not satisfied with the camera quality while taking photos dont ever try to use effects such as 34beauty effect34 or 34panorama34 because the resultant image will be worst than the normal image taken without any effects photos shot from this phones camera gets distorted and you can notice noise in the images if you zoom a bit better buy htc 820 instead of 820s  htc you disappointed me
1877	HTC Desire 820s (Milkyway Gray)	phone is awesome in performance wise but totally crap for camera  each  evry pic from this mob is crap if you wanna gud camera dont go for this mob evrything else is gud u can also chek pic which i had uploaded from this mob itself

1894	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	edit installed 84 today still as flawless as new one more reasons to own this now  just launched apple music is your ticket to unlimited songs for 120 rs and 5c is your cheapest option to brilliant apple ecosystem on to the review now  so you always wanted to get on iphone and you have been slowly but surely been attracted to the 5c but could not make up your mind or you just want an upgrade to your age old iphone 4 and 4s lets try to create an unbiased opinion from my 1 year of regular business experience of using iphone 5c  please note i am not an apple or android fanboy i use what serves me best and do not think any one company owns my allegiance i use an iphone with nexus 7 fhd take that yes i am using android 51 with ios 84 and love it also my last phone was galaxy nexus  first the pros and cons you will see i have mentioned ios pros and cons too in the review the fact is you cannot separate apple software from hardware and look at it objectively those who compare just the hardware specs are missing the point same goes for macs what you get with the hardware is an os that is mated seamlessly with the gadgetry lots of work has went into it and is in development for more than any other modern mobile os so when you buy iphone  you open a door into apple ecosystem it may not be best thing since sliced bread but sometimes all you need is a change  please do not go on comparing ram and cpu with android devices treat it as iphone  ios make ios work for your needs  pros  1 ios 84 is a great change for those who have been sticking with other oses it is modern feature rich and not as limiting as you may initially have thought 2 ios 84 runs perfectly on iphone 5c this is the latest ios release till now and it runs as it would brand new iphone 5c maybe unapologetically plastic but the plastic is of great quality it is almost like ceramic  glossy and dense build quality is solid feels good in hand 3 it maybe 4 inch display but ios uses the screen real estate very nicely until iphone 6 the whole os  was optimized for this screen size keyboard is great android may have caught up with lollypop but still i was pleasantly surprised when i first started typing on it it felt natural in fact i could type faster on it than any previous device with bit of practice you will feel at home easily 4 animations and eye candy is finally not an hindrance since the os is liquid smooth animations affects and drop downs blend seamlessly if you are coming from a slow android device this can be a revelation 5 many will gravitate towards white iphone 5c  and will ask the perennial question  will the white color dulls to offwhite over time with over an years use i can say no resoundingly it is still the sparkling white which i bought look  build quality and materials matter 6 very very pocketable 7 great for one handed use i had a lot of one handed usage problems with on my old 47 phone but this one is a sure winner in that department answering emails on from the bed could not be easier 8 screen quality is superior than most devices in market on full brightness it almost seems like a sheet of paper and yes you can keep it on full brightness without worrying about its battery i am looking at you half of the android out there 9 audio and voice clarity is above par 10 charges very quickly just keep a proper car charges with you and you will never worry about running out of battery on the move if you keep it turned on with gps for navigation and car charger plugged in the rate of battery drain will be less than the charging rate 11 default is email app is a classic never felt the need to get an aftermarket app handles multiple emails accounts smoothly 12 new apple apple apps like icloud drive work perfectly with windows for file storage itunes too works fine on microsoft os 13 it maybe subjective but i find the new ios beautiful in aesthetics after seeing flats of metro ui microsoft and material design of android this is a breath of fresh air their is certain lightness in it that being said i am also a big fan of material design and was a big fan of metro ui 14 hardware silent button dont know how i have been living without it till now 15 some people find the apple logo in the back sort of status symbol i am not one of that although it can be advantage for some 16 great camera never disappoints for quick candid clicks lots of editing options too  cons  1 lowest rung in apples phone ladder if you buy it for status a recent price drop and new larger and more expensive iphones may sour it for you 2 apple is known to release a new iphone around september with this years release 2015 5c will likely get phased out or be sold in third world countries only 3 small screen  okay i do believe large screen has some advantages but i think those start from 7 and above  reading books watching movies comics gloating over suppressed wallpapers and so on but then most people only like to keep a single mobile device thus they would rather get something of both worlds 4 lightening cable for charging now you cannot just borrow usb cable of your colleague on next cubicle to do a quick charge better keep a lightening cable ready i keep one at home one in the car and one on my desk  5 would not work as a storage unit when connected to pc or mac those who have got used to putting all the stuff in their phones  caution no file manager either 6 notification center not as robust as android android lollipop only embarrasses it further 7 google ecosystem is comparatively weak on iphone but dont get me wrong  it is still way better than windows phone or blackberry 10 if you are a heavy google apps user just do a bit more research before buying 8 if you already have an android tablet and you are paranoid about keeping your data in sync across desktop tablet and phone  you are doomed hint  google 9 not well localized for india  there is a rupee symbol though but voice playback is distinctively american android does it better 10 built quality not as good as iphone 5 5s and above 11 8gb is awfully low you only get 5gb odd after first boot  thats it folks now in short iphone does not disappoints for what its worth it is good solid phone and if you are bored with similar looking android devices maybe it is time for a change  who knows at the same time takes as a whole this is a very well put together phone with a strong focus on phone part i loved its reliability battery life and quick charging
1895	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	i have used a samsung android phone and nokiamicrosoft lumia windows phone for less than 2 years i was looking at htc phablet before buying this iphone iphone 5c is a different kind of experience altogether it has the top notch build quality you expect from apple though it is made out of plastic it looks tough it already survived one fall and it looks as if i will retire that only when i am tired of it  it has only 8gb out of which ios 83 takes up about 29 gb leaving you with just about 5 gb in the initial stages but once you get going with a few routine apps the space dwindles to 3 gb the reason i am happy with this phone is  there is no perceptible lag at all android and windows phone lagged so badly at times that neither the phone nor me realized what button i pressed  almost everything is built in right there  siri compass gps to name a few personal assistant siri is far better than my earlier lumias cortana siri chimes in without running down the battery
1896	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	pros  prestigious  many people saw me using other expensive phones earlier yet no one wondered but when i bought this phone i got tremendous attraction from friends to mere acquaintances everyone asking 34hey you got iphone wow when how much34 and all number one in brand value even if it is plastic  call quality awesome unbeatable in earpiece speaker as well handsfree  camera is fantastic extremely fast in capturing good quality photos even hdr but only in bright light simple and direct user interface no complex submenu kind of interface front camera is also awesome selfies and video calls are crystal clear for 12mp camera  display is excellent best brightness control one of the few controls given to user by apple  music quality is amazing both in speaker as well as headset  performance is top notch let it be apps or 3d games runs like fluid for just 1gb ram rarely lags are observed 1 still tolerable  when compared to android phones which pack huge rams like 2gb  apps like weather app if it rains the app will show like its raining inside your iphone mail app compass ibooks facetime and their user interfaces are really superb additional keyboard support and third party widget support are all welcome features  3g internet connectivity is very fast  some peculiar ui elements are amazing for example if you shake the phone the wall paper will seem to shake a bit you have to carefully observe that animated clock icon showing current time calendar icon too showing current date dynamically updating icon images is not seen anywhere kudos to apple for this  bestinclass security if an app wants to access your contacts or location info a popup will appear asking whether to give permission or deny it anytime you can change this permission in settings for every app independently this is something missing in android where you have to agree with all the permissions of an app while installing  cons  only 8gb internal memory and also not expandable out of 8gb only 5gb is available for usage you have to constantly backup data to your pc or cloud and then delete them extremely worst behaviour  you cannot clear app data independently as you do in android for example if facebook app reaches 300mb in my phone i can clear only app data leaving the app intact in android but in iphone you have to delete the entire app and reinstall from start if you need anymore extremely worst  minimum freedom in the whole earth given to users for customisation it appears as 34iphone this is what you should do and i decide that user yes sir34 the term 34jailbreaking34 is 100 right term as you will feel like you are in jail when using this phone  there are no inapp settings and only centralised settings for example if you are using safari and you want to change some settings for it you have to get out of the app and go to settings app find safari there among several items and change settings there there is no inapp settings menu for any of the apps worst  for lowlight photos very worst camera quality  too noisy pictures  namesake bluetooth  they simply would have eliminated this useless bluetooth i am not able to connect even to my macbook pro which is itself an apple product though my nexus 7 beautifully connects to my mac no bluetooth connectivity to other platform devices like android extremely worst behaviour  you cannot set your favourite song as ringtone just as easily as you do in android phones complex process using itunes need to be followed you may also see surprises in setting caller photos worst  safari sucks as a browser use chrome instead they promised 34request desktop site34 in ios 8 i am using 81 still its not there also you cannot search for required text in a web page using safari have to go for chrome or opera mini for this shame on this phone for missing such basic features  spelling suggestions are available only in few apps like messages mail and notes its missing in browsers and all others worst  keyboard always shows uppercase worst in android phones keys change to upper case and lower case as per user selection allowing users to intuitively know which case they are going to type  location accuracy is at its worst i took a photo in one place while my iphone geotagged that photo to be shot at an incorrect location very far away again android phones rock here  very worst phone app and calculator app if you mistakenly typed one middle number wrong in a sequence of numbers you have to entirely delete it and retype from the start same is the case with typing a phone number in phone app for a smart phone it should not be like that android phones rock in this area  headphones are not much convenient to the ear and causes pain as it is plastic they should have made it like inear type feeling smoother to the ear  buttons are not smooth but too rigid causes clicking noise when you press them also the charging pin is too tight to connect to and  disconnect from the phone worst  wifi hotspot sometimes unidentifiable if not identified check if the screen is locked you have unlock it and set portable hotspot off and on again also it automatically enables bluetooth also why unnecessarily drain battery on that its well known that iphone bluetooth is a crap very worst  no widget is available for onetouch enabling of internet in control centre where torch wifi bluetooth are available except internet connectivity every time you have to go to settings 62 cellular 62 onoff worst  although difference in style of widgets is appreciable its not much attractive as in android anyway its bearable  battery is not bad but still should have been with higher capacity at least to compete with android phones bearable
1897	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	fell in love just after unboxing it is an amazing phone  only limitation i have found limited storage just 5 gb usable  but until i download a heavy game like asphalt  real racing or so i am getting a free space of 14 gb  i have around 200 songs2 video songs 15 photos and around 23 apps including facebook whatsapp etc as per me it is manageable if you know to manage the space using some cloud tricksthere is nothing to say about iphone camera though it is a 8mp only but trust me it will give you a dslr like pcture music clarity is mind blowing as per me i am using a classy phone at 19990 rupees what else can i ask a big thumbs up to amazon
1898	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	hi  i ordered an iphone on 27 february 2015 and the product was delivered to me on 4 march 2015 it was with factory software of the version ios 812 later i upgraded it with itunes to 82 last 28 march 2015 now what is happening to the phone is that the touch is sometimes not working properly even in find contacts i tried to type tubai last night and i couldnt suddenly i discovered that uhjni are the letters that are not working at all an iphone is worth rupees 25000 and this is what apple is providing service with  please do guide me what should i do  regards arnav
1899	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	amazing phone i bought the pink iphone 5c as a gift last week and really liked it so i ordered another white 5c yesterday and got it earlier today at first i was not too sure these coloured iphones would look very good but once i unpacked i was blown away with its styling and high build quality the feel when you hold it is also very good due to the glossy smooth body unlike its sibling the iphone 55s setup was a breeze just took a few minutes like all apple devices the intended user of this phone was moving to this from the iphone 5 just by signing into icloud all the contacts appeared immediately and there were no hassles in getting all the other apps and settings ready this phone is proof that you do not need quard or octa core chips for high performance  there is only one thing i would have liked apple to do that is to keep the storage at a minimum of 16gb i knew 8gb was on the lower side so i immediately downloaded a couple of great appsflickr and dropbox that can instantly backup photos and videos which would end up consuming a major chunk of the space on this phone in case you have not used flicker it is a great option because it offers 1tb of free online storage and you can auto backup photos thereby allowing you to delete and free up space on the phone
1900	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	have been using iphone for 6 years and brought this for my dad  seems to be good and similar in performance to iphone 5 with no major change in the 5c  not a big fan of the plastic finish
1901	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	amazing phone i bought three of these phones in the last couple of weeks a whte pink and green all colours look great before i bought these i was not too sure these coloured iphones would look very good but once i unpacked i was blown away with its styling and high build quality the feel when you hold it is also very good due to the glossy smooth body unlike its sibling the iphone 55s this phone has a brilliant sharp display and the best touch sensitivityresponse combined with amazing performance this phone is proof that you do not need quard or octa core chips for high performance setup was a breeze just took a few minutes like all apple devices the intended user of this phone was moving to this from a windows phone  there is only one thing i would have liked apple to do that is to keep the storage at a minimum of 16gb i knew 8gb was on the lower side but there are a few apps out there that can help manage the things that consume most space on smartphonesphotos and videos some of the first few apps i downloaded were to address this i installed a couple of great appsflickr and dropbox that can instantly backup photos and videos which would end up consuming a major chunk of the space on this phone in case you have not used flicker it is a great option because it offers 1tb of free online storage and you can auto backup photos thereby allowing you to delete and free up space on the phone
1902	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	its amazing phone writing this review after using windows and android for long time it never hangs up the only problem is with memory which is 5 gb for use
1903	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	completely satisfied with cloud tail as well as amazon delivered within 5 days of payment completely working no problems at all completely brand new all accessories working it was the second time we had ordered the same phone as the first time the home button was unresponsive even though the money we paid for the first one hasnt been credited back to our account yet we hope it will be and as far as the new phone is considered we have no problems at all
1904	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	i change phones and os almost every 6 months  so yes i have used blackberrynokia  windowsandroid  all except for ios i had avoided iphone because the techie in me couldnt justify spending a fortune on technology that is available at half the price by most other brands in market and how wrong i was   if you are looking for a machine where you can enter developer mode and code your own interfaces  customize the hardware acceleration etc etc  then iphone is not for you  or so i thought it is a powerpacked  meticulously  almost lovingly designed phone  its a product which subtly impress  so much so that after a few hours of usage you know that it will not be easy to replace this phone
1905	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	please do not buy this product this is not a new phone but a refurbished one i have been using iphones for long now and could clearly make out the difference between the new and the refurbished ons on the outlook the phone appears to be just fine and works fine sometimes but some functions become unresponsive at other moments here seems no point to pay for an original iphone when you are getting  refurbished one
1906	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	git a new iphone 5c yestrrdaystarted hanging during language setting n then turned offaaftrr that power onoff button not workingdidnt expect this from amazon n iphone n d seller to sell the defective piece
1907	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	after using several android phones this comes as a welcome change for the price it is ok i would however advice others to take a 16gb phone as i found that 8gb is just not enough
1908	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	value for money got installed with 812 which is still jail breakable jail broken the device and removed unnecessary other country languages and other stuff that is taking up the os space  was able to save around 6gb of space out of 8gb actual  i already had a camera connection kit for my old ipad used the same using a 30 pin to lightning converter bought for rs 250 so able to use my 64gb microsd and a low power 16gb pen drive
1909	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	i ordered this amazing phone on 29th december as a new year gift for my wife and i must say it was a fantastic decision  that i made the phone was delivered before the delivery date and the phone is new and original i checked on the apple support website as i was very skeptical about the online phones and is under 1yr warranty as an iphone it is fantastic to use battery is working fine with some optimization a complete thumbs up to the product as my wife is more into user interface and look  feel of the product not much into apps games etc  and guys if you have some apprehensions about the plastic body then let me tell you it is way better than many of the metal bodies out their in the market  thanks amazon and cloudtail for the great experience
1910	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	phones home button stopped working in less than one month of purchase i had bought this phone testing device for app and was rarely used which means that it is very bad workmanship that has gone into this device to keep the price low out of 8gb  you only get around 45 gigs of space left of installing new app i felt the device is only good for testingdevelopment and not worth daily use
1911	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	so you always wanted to get on iphone and you have been slowly but surely been attracted to the 5c but could not make up your mind or you just want an upgrade to your age old iphone 4 and 4s lets try to create an unbiased opinion from my 1 year of regular business experience of using iphone 5c  please note i am not an apple or android fanboy i use what serves me best and do not think any one company owns my allegiance i use an iphone with nexus 7 fhd take that yes i am using android 51 with ios 83 and love it also my last phone was galaxy nexus  first the pros and cons you will see i have mentioned ios pros and cons too in the review the fact is you cannot separate apple software from hardware and look at it objectively those who compare just the hardware specs are missing the point same goes for macs what you get with the hardware is an os that is mated seamlessly with the gadgetry lots of work has went into it and is in development for more than any other modern mobile os so when you buy iphone  you open a door into apple ecosystem it may not be best thing since sliced bread but sometimes all you need is a change  please do not go on comparing ram and cpu with android devices treat it as iphone  ios make ios work for your needs  pros  1 ios 83 is a great change for those who have been sticking with other oses it is modern feature rich and not as limiting as you may initially have thought 2 ios 83 runs perfectly on iphone 5c this is the latest ios release till now and it runs as it would brand new iphone 5c maybe unapologetically plastic but the plastic is of great quality it is almost like ceramic  glossy and dense build quality is solid feels good in hand 3 it maybe 4 inch display but ios uses the screen real estate very nicely until iphone 6 the whole os was optimized for this screen size keyboard is great android may have caught up with lollypop but still i was pleasantly surprised when i first started typing on it it felt natural in fact i could type faster on it than any previous device with bit of practice you will feel at home easily 4 animations and eye candy is finally not an hindrance since the os is liquid smooth animations affects and drop downs blend seamlessly if you are coming from a slow android device this can be a revelation 5 many will gravitate towards white iphone 5c  and will ask the perennial question  will the white color dulls to offwhite over time with over an years use i can say no resoundingly it is still the sparkling white which i bought look  build quality and materials matter 6 very very pocketable 7 great for one handed use i had a lot of one handed usage problems with on my old 47 phone but this one is a sure winner in that department answering emails on from the bed could not be easier 8 screen quality is superior than most devices in market on full brightness it almost seems like a sheet of paper and yes you can keep it on full brightness without worrying about its battery i am looking at you half of the android out there 9 audio and voice clarity is above par 10 charges very quickly just keep a proper car charges with you and you will never worry about running out of battery on the move if you keep it turned on with gps for navigation and car charger plugged in the rate of battery drain will be less than the charging rate 11 default is email app is a classic never felt the need to get an aftermarket app handles multiple emails accounts smoothly 12 new apple apple apps like icloud drive work perfectly with windows for file storage itunes too works fine on microsoft os 13 it maybe subjective but i find the new ios beautiful in aesthetics after seeing flats of metro ui microsoft and material design of android this is a breath of fresh air their is certain lightness in it that being said i am also a big fan of material design and was a big fan of metro ui 14 hardware silent button dont know how i have been living without it till now 15 some people find the apple logo in the back sort of status symbol i am not one of that although it can be advantage for some 16 great camera never disappoints for quick candid clicks lots of editing options too  cons  1 lowest rung in apples phone ladder if you buy it for status a recent price drop and new larger and more expensive iphones may sour it for you 2 apple is known to release a new iphone around september with this years release 2015 5c will likely get phased out or be sold in third world countries only 3 small screen  okay i do believe large screen has some advantages but i think those start from 7 and above  reading books watching movies comics gloating over suppressed wallpapers and so on but then most people only like to keep a single mobile device thus they would rather get something of both worlds 4 lightening cable for charging now you cannot just borrow usb cable of your colleague on next cubicle to do a quick charge better keep a lightening cable ready i keep one at home one in the car and one on my desk  5 would not work as a storage unit when connected to pc or mac those who have got used to putting all the stuff in their phones  caution no file manager either 6 notification center not as robust as android android lollypop only embarrasses it further 7 google ecosystem is comparatively weak on iphone but dont get me wrong  it is still way better than windows phone or blackberry 10 if you are a heavy google apps user just do a bit more research before buying 8 if you already have an android tablet and you are paranoid about keeping your data in sync across desktop tablet and phone  you are doomed hint  google 9 not well localized for india  there is a rupee symbol though but voice playback is distinctively american android does it better 10 built quality not as good as iphone 5 5s and above 11 8gb is awfully low you only get 5gb odd after first boot  thats it folks now in short iphone does not disappoints for what its worth it is good solid phone and if you are bored with similar looking android devices maybe it is time for a change  who knows at the same time takes as a whole this is a very well put together phone with a strong focus on phone part i loved its reliability battery life and quick charging
1912	Apple iPhone 5c (White, 8GB)	amazing phone i bought three of these phones in the last couple of weeks a whte pink and green all colours look great before i bought these i was not too sure these coloured iphones would look very good but once i unpacked i was blown away with its styling and high build quality the feel when you hold it is also very good due to the glossy smooth body unlike its sibling the iphone 55s this phone has a brilliant sharp display and the best touch sensitivityresponse combined with amazing performance this phone is proof that you do not need quard or octa core chips for high performance setup was a breeze just took a few minutes like all apple devices the intended user of this phone was moving to this from a windows phone  there is only one thing i would have liked apple to do that is to keep the storage at a minimum of 16gb i knew 8gb was on the lower side but there are a few apps out there that can help manage the things that consume most space on smartphonesphotos and videos some of the first few apps i downloaded were to address this i installed a couple of great appsflickr and dropbox that can instantly backup photos and videos which would end up consuming a major chunk of the space on this phone in case you have not used flicker it is a great option because it offers 1tb of free online storage and you can auto backup photos thereby allowing you to delete and free up space on the phone

1925	Samsung Galaxy Core 2 (Black)	device was restart every 15 minutes from the date of delivery realy hate amazon for this type of material supply
1926	Samsung Galaxy Core 2 (Black)	i purchased 2 handsets of the samsung galaxy core 2 smg355h black 1st on 23122014 which was perfectly okay and the set and battery were of november 2014 batches but the 2nd handset with accompanying battery that i bought in january 2015 were of june 2014 batches i find the battery to be weak from the very start the seller has be careful to dispatch products of current batches to buyers consistently so as to maintain the goodwill of amazonin

1930	Samsung Galaxy Core 2 (Black)	it is available in just 7800 in open market and also battery is too weak to sustain for even 10 hrshanged while you use itbought it 20 days back from samsung store noida
1931	Samsung Galaxy Core 2 (Black)	there are many good phones available in the market for just a thousand or two more than the price of this phone samsung tries to conquer every segment in the market therefore it launches a new product without even analyzing the demands of the users  pros 1 android 442 with touchwiz out of the box 2 expandable memory upto 64gb 3 dual sim  cons 1 low resolution screen480 x 800 pixels 2 low inbuilt memory4gb 3 average battery2000 mah 4 average camera 5 low resolution video recording in camera ie 640x480 vga  even after being launched in mid may of 2014 the phone is hardly able to beat last years launches in the same price range like moto g come on samsung we expected more from you not a good buy
1932	Samsung Galaxy Core 2 (Black)	i bought this phone before one month and i am fully disappointed with its performance from the second day after purchasing the device it began restart automatically without any reason the problem still continues
1933	Samsung Galaxy Core 2 (Black)	excellent
1934	Samsung Galaxy Core 2 (Black)	i specially liked its design and its  a quite good looking phone with  considerable features and also with a good user interface but a major defect is its ram and internal memory which is less than it should be according to me

1944	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, Black)	this is an awesome product from microsoft i have using lumia phone for the past 2 years its much better than android phones never lags smoother touch better performance awesome camera etc are the best part of lumia phones i can give 95100 for this phone
1945	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, Black)	design  7510 features  7510 performance  810 camera 810 battery 7510 software  810 value for money 710  with a screen size of 57 inches compared to the 5innch display of the 640 the lumia 640 xl is one of microsofts largest smartphones just shy of the lumia 1520s 6inch behemothalthough the size of the screen is increased with the lumia 640 xl the resolution remains the same at 1080p which means the smaller lumia 640s screen is sharper thanks to an increased pixel density  i noticed that the performance of windows phone 81 was fine on the lumia 640 xl if nothing spectacular considering the the midrange specifications which include a qualcomm snapdragon 400 soc with a quadcore 12ghz cpu and 1gb of ram this should come as no surprise  the rear camera is 13mp and slightly protrudes from the back of the phone its more pronounced than the iphone 6s bulging snapper and means that if youre a fan of lying your phone face up and flat on a table the lumia 640 xls design could prove annoying there is also a front facing camera which is good for skype  verdict  if you fancy a phablet sized smartphone but dont want to pay the high prices of that many such as the nexus 6 and iphone 6 plus demand then the microsoft lumia 640 xl could be of interest though the lower resolution and current lack of support for windows phone though microsoft promises this will change with the universal apps platform might be a few too many compromises

1947	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, Black)	windows lumia 640 xl review hi folks bought this mobile on amazon sale and has been using it since past 2 days this i my experience so far  pros 1 big screen with superb contrast text and image just pop out of the screen and is really pleasing to eyes  2 smooth interface does not lag a bit  3 13 mp camera is good with manual controls like adjustment for focus or shutter speed low light pics are a little grainy have not used camera much till now  4 light weight does not heat up on extend usage  5 cortana an alternative to apple s siri is available  6 superb build quality and looks sturdy and premium  7 office 365 and radio mix  8 3000 mah battery goes upto 2days on decent usage  9 all apps are sandboxed so no threat of virus hence there is no antivirus app made from windows phone wow  cons 1 if you come from android background this is one thing that is going to pinch you most no chrome or firefox no google maps nokia maps is there no youtube app you will have to buy an alternative which i believe is better than native youtube app on android if you want good apps you will have to spend few bucks like alternative to mx player apart from that all other basic apps are available ola uber foodpanda sbi irctc etc etc but seriously say byebye to google owned apps  2 old hardware qualcomm msm8226 snapdragon 400 is a little outdated hardware for a new phone i believe 12 ghz and quadcore works well but i would be more happy if microsoft could have updated the hardware still since windows is smoother and lighter than android you will not feel any lag  3 no 4g support again lagging behind on this front  4 pixel density at 259 ppi this takes away the pleasure of watching hd movies though this thing is compensated by clearblack display and high contrast ratio but i really wished they would have put up a better screen  overall windows platform is a growing platform so there are some fronts where windows will have to catch up like apps overall this is a decent phone with great build good camera big display dual sim and a community of its own if you are apps savvy and lover of super fine display this is not a phone for you if you are productivity oriented and use officelync on the go want a phone with no hassle and great battery backup listen to music read a lot and do basic stuff then close your eyes and go for it as a professional this is the best phone for me in this price range  update 1 i m disappointed by number of outdated  apps no calling feature in whatsapp amazon shopping app is disappointing zinio the magzine app was updated in last 2014 moreover the windows platform itself is constrained cannot edit url in ie once pasted sometime text gets stuck no scroll bar for easy scrolling you have to keep scrolling the list with finger which is again very slow also text gets blurred on some websites i am waiting for windows 10 update without win 10 this phone is just average with 3 stars  update 2 whatsapp has been updated with call feature since june i am seeing more and more apps getting updated url problem also solved text used to get blurry in some sites which has again been solved i hope this trend continues upgrading rating from a 3 to 4 stars
1948	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, Black)	i ordered product based on the postive review at many places i am totally satisfied with the product  postives  big quaility and ultra smooth screen quite fast response of the mobile camera with amazing clarity front and back both  negatives lack of apps compare to android plateform wifi connectivity has some issue sometimes i have to restart  please activate wifi sense also for contious net connection  with this negative points it is still one of the best option of windows mobile lover  i am enjoying it
1949	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, Black)	first of all its a budget phone so do not expect super fast speed but with the given processor it does work smoothly in all day to day tasks playing super graphics games is a decent experience if you have some patience now for this price point a lot of people shall be happy what they are getting 720p display 13mp back and 5 mp front camera zeiss optics along with that whole windows experience the phone is in my point of view a very good buy for the price and works flawlessly for average user battery is huge as well so no issues with that if you want to experience windows phone on a big screen and do not want to shell out extra cash for 1520 then this is the phone for you alternatively lumia 730 on small screen gives you the same experience
1950	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, Black)	microsofts new addition to its lumia series lumia 640 xl looks smart with its specs does it really offers smart things lets check out  13 megapixel camera from microsoftnokia is an attractive spec as it is from redmont giant with no compromise in quality added to that is carl zeiss lens with led flash so you got a real camera phone  front camera of 5 megapixel has become an essential thing in selfie world this also got one with wide angle view for skype experience too  1gb of ram with 8 gb internal in which system files take around half of it i wonder why lumia doesnt go for 16 gb internal but you got 128 gb exp via sd card  installation of apps and games can be done on sd card as windows 81 offers that denim version with alpha version of cortana also a welcomable feature  without internet cortana cannot be used except for few functions smart dual sim is the best feature as you wont miss a call during a call on another sim  features snapdragon processor with clock speed of 12 ghz sure to deliver smooth performance  5734 display in 720p resolution is good but with less ppi for this display may suffer when we compare the screen with smaller lumia phones we have clearblack display with gorilla glass  battery will last long for 15 days the best is it is upgradable to windows 10  if u want bigger screen with great camera just go for this one 4g version of this will be smart choice as of now comparingly you may choose for nokia lumia 730 with similar features and this exceeds in camera when compared to 730
1951	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, Black)	i have been using dual sim phones for quite some time now and lumia series was the one that i wanted to test i checked this hardware at a store and the functions were really impressive quite different from androids that i am used to mostly i found good points and here they are  a the camera was very responsive and good non pixelated images b after 30 min usage battery was almost the same c display was very sharp and vibrant d the qualcomm cpu was at its best during heavy usage

1955	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, Black)	the phone is good good features pretty fast with good display and battery back up with the internet on i got more than 2 days with over 30 charge remaining with single sim  charger is not up to the requirement takes a lot of time to charge charges much faster with the samsung charger for the phone with similar battery capacity   no data cable after paying a fairly good amount we expect it also in the bundle  just an average headphone even micromax and lava gives better ones for the phones less than a third of its price  thumbs down for the headphone charger and missing data cable

1964	Lenovo P70 (Midnight Blue)	initial impression of the phone lenovo p70 is a good mobile with good battery backup first i have to mention about amazons prompt delivery mobile looks good before buying the phone i was of the opinion that it might weigh heavy due to the 4000 mah battery but it is not that heavy the design is very good hardware wise it is a good one but i am still bit disappointed that a7000 is priced half of p70 and both have almost same configuration except for p70 having a much bigger battery however my main intention of purchasing this product is for the battery backup everything is fine except for the camera camera quality is pathetic i had a chinese branded phone previously and it had 12 mega pixel and it was far far better than lenovo p70s 13 mp camera i am yet to come to terms of p70s camera quality how come lenovo came up with such pathetic camera in p70 thats it for now i will keep updating this review during the course of time thanks for reading
1965	Lenovo P70 (Midnight Blue)	this phone by lenovo is a fine quality product at this price range full points to amazon and seller for quick delivery1 day delivery  of course i did pay for it though p  so far great performance as expected from an octa core processor it does heat up a little while charging and playing games well most smartphone does no lags whatsoever does have a vibrant displayviewing angles are great battery backup is good great standby time i mean really great easily gets you through a whole day without charging gaming  calling  surfing wifi  speakers are not as loud as one would expect it does not have a dual speaker speaker mesh on the right is just for show or for an unknown purpose camera quality is not so great but not bad either both rear and front no android lolipop update so far  waiting for it overall a good phone for this price bracket

1984	HTC Desire 526G Plus (Dual SIM, Glacier Blue)	within a few days the glossy finish of the phone started peeling due to the limited return policy of the phone the phone cannot be exchanged and we are at a loss
1985	HTC Desire 526G Plus (Dual SIM, Glacier Blue)	im in taiwan so i was shopping for the lastest value smartphone  my iphone was having problems after connecting to my macbook pro that has an os x yosemite update  a few of my friends were raving about the zenfone from asus  great value and the zenfone is also catching on in japan  as i was ready to buy the zenfone this htc 526g just arrived the day before so it is the newest htc phone and the newest phone in town  i couldnt help but notice how pretty this htc phone is and the finish is luxurious  it looks like an upscale phone to me  there are two colors to choose from one is glossy all black  i choose the white one with blue edge and the case looks like it has an expensive lacquer lol  the zenfone is very nice but its case with metallic paint does not feel as expensive  the zenfone has a lot of satisfied customers and the photos in daylight are excellent  the first 2 nights i charged it fully and for the next 2 days the battery seem to last barely a day  so i was pretty pissed  theyve got to cut the cost somewhere i thought  however after having the phone for 2 weeks im happy to report that the battery lasts forever well not forever but you get the idea perhaps 5 days with minimal use  right after getting it i notice the phone powers up very fast  im no phonegamer so i really wasnt concerned about speed but this thing is fast  8 cores  my macbook pro is only 2 cores why would i need a phone with 8 cores  the camera is excellent even in macro mode  and it has a nice led  flash  the pictures are very nice and the colors are excellent  i paid 3990 ntd which is 130 usd and i feel  like i robbed the store

1988	HTC Desire 526G Plus (Dual SIM, Glacier Blue)	under this price range the phone exceeds customer expectations in several aspects meets expectations in few areas but disappoints in some serious areas exceeds the expectation design internal memory 16gb octacore processor expandable up to 32 gb  meets the expectations gamingi tried with subway surf not bigger games audio quality ram1 gb photos in daylight both selfie n rear dual 3g sim battery no heating problem despite prolonged usage  disappoints customer night and flash photographs very poor and grainy makes u feel like u r using some vga camera and shooting at night only under exceptional lighting conditions u should take photos with this phone lock and volume keys look like they will break anytime   hope the review was helpful 
1989	HTC Desire 526G Plus (Dual SIM, Glacier Blue)	do not buy this phone its a fine phone but the glossy finish paint will start coming off in about 10 days and will look like its months old better to save some more money and buy another better phone dont waste your money on this theres a reason why people dont buy htc handsets

2005	Panasonic Eluga S (Black)	phone looks great from outsidebut what really matters is its softwarethough its running latest kitkat 442it has a major glitch in itwhen u pop out ur sim card slot and place ur sim in it for the second time device is asking for password which we havent created at allthis problem doesnt occur when u first boot ur phone with sim card popped inbut when u replace ur sim card for the next time its asking for passwordits annoying like anythingwhen u call customer care they would give u a password of 123456 which really doesnt work on this devicei gave the device to service center on 3rd march but having it for 3 days service center people couldnt able to sort out this problemhence they have sent my device  main service center in delhi to sort out the problemafter a month and half i got the phone in my hand from the local service centerwhat really surprised me after receiving it was the phone i got was really not my phonethey said they couldnt resolve the issue on ma phone hence they have given a new phone to mei was happy at tat time since i got a new one but it did remained only for some hoursthe new phone again troubled methe sensors were not working and there was a creep sound exists always at the back as the phone was not well carved and the sd card slot cover got broken i called the regional sales head on phone but he was very arrogant by naturehe told tat this s the device for u and he cant provide assistance anymore and if you want to do anything u can do itits done hence i request the customers to think twice before buying a panasonic devicedont go for panasonic devices as it is not worthy as they advertise in tv or other medias
2006	Panasonic Eluga S (Black)	phone was good with nice features but i got phone with slightly broken sim slot and sim tray was not proper in second slot my sim was blocked inside the phone and lost my card thanks to amazon to take return my phoneservice of amazon is fantastic very prompt and customer perspective give 5 rating to amazon
2007	Panasonic Eluga S (Black)	i bought this phone a week back the phone is quite light in weight slim and has a leather feel at the back panel which gives a very nice a sturdy feel while hand it looks quite classy the screen resolution is very good it gives very sharp crisp picture quality with quite rich colors the 720p videos play properly without any lag front camera is really good 5mp giving good quality selfies primary camera lives up to the mark sound quality is good enough loudspeaker gives a decent volume with good quality when connected to my home theatre and car the audio quality was quite good much better than samsung phones the touch is very smooth and responsive did not experience any lag till now inspite of 1 gb ram the custom ui provided helps to handle phone using one hand which is quite useful for a 5 inches screen there is an option to switch to standard kitkat ui as well the battery takes some time to charge but lasts quite well when fully charged and normal usage during the day whatsapp music browsing few calls the battery showed 48 charge remaining i found this better than my xperia zr overall a great value for money under 10k catagory i agree that panasonic as a brand is not that well known for mobiles and even i was a bit skeptical before buying this so i first saw the demo in stores before buying and found it to be good as the store was charging me more with additional charge on card swipe i bought this on amazon overall the phone looks great works great
2008	Panasonic Eluga S (Black)	its very good phone just started using it
2009	Panasonic Eluga S (Black)	writing this review after 3 months of this use its a very good phone good speed ui is awesome battery life is also good we can go for this i bought this phone after 2 months of search and was very confused with other phones camera quality is really awesome very very good had plans to take moto g but after seeing it with my frnd the camera quality of moto g is not good and we need to go to gallery to access the picts taken but the options and features is really very good in eluga s i would suggest every one to go for this u will really love it i have no cons on this phone no lags or hanging of this phone superb

2011	Panasonic Eluga S (Black)	i have been using my panasonic eluga s for more than 15 months now i am very much satisfied with the phone particularly the camera picture quality 8 mp speed design and earphone sound quality taking selfie is just a blink of the eyes now and produces a true 5 mp picture panasonic brand also puts the phone in premium segment considering the quality  price its definitely a better option compared to motog
2012	Panasonic Eluga S (Black)	non removable battery is the only thing i did not liked rest of the product is good

2034	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	just an awesome phone at an unbelievable price gives a straight knock to those low budget phones having similar specs since after three months of usage i havent encountered a single lag nor does the phone heats up on multitasking coming to the cameras8mp rear shooter is super fine in quality clicks in macro mode too colors and saturation are just intact just one problem the soundis not upto the mark rest i give it a thumbs up moreover it will get the latest lollipop update by september 2015  i cannot leave the battery however fully charged i used it to play games like subway surfers and flappy bird for over 4 hours listened music used gps and after 24 hours i was left with 11 of the acid left no issues here also i am sharing some pictures clicked by htc desire 620g dual sim hope this helps you
2035	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	after waiting for over 4 months and looking at countless phones finally settled on this one about me i am a journalist who reviews tech and hence it is really hard to please me i didnt want to spend over 20k on my phone and that was the only limit i had set lets go about the things one by one  1 display really good high pixel density display that never puts you off as long as you keep it on autobrightness and let it do its magic in different ambient settings sun legibility is top notch too  2 processing although it is a really short time to say about its long term prowess but the processor and ram look capable of pulling just about any stunt i have so installed a total of 200 apps on my phone with blinkfeed set up and notifications on for instagram twitter whatsapp hike and emails but the phone never slows down for a mili second previously used nexus 5 moto e and moto g  3 battery life since i am mostly out and lazy enough to not charge my devices every moment i was keen on getting a device with a lasting battery but this is a massive powerhouse when it comes to battery i used it all day with sync on and 3g data with half an hour calling and no games and the battery is still at 70 at the end of the evening very impressed  4 keyboard even though i am not a fan of inbuilt keyboards i found the htc sense keyboard pretty usable but switched to my trusted swiftkey on the second day to type while i swipe my fingers when walking around works like a charm  5 camera the camera quality is several points higher compared to the moto g2 and the front camera is perfect for selfies even though i hate them  6 body the make of the phone is quite pleasing but the back is glossy fixed it with a matte finish back panel  7 notification led missing from the phone but you are unlikely to miss it that much especially with the dot matrix cover google it  8 overall the phone is a definite value for money device and comes with that extra appeal thats missing in bland moto devices and a pleasing htc ui which got updated the first thing when i booted device  verdict specs on the paper fall like marbles in comparison to the overall performance of this device extremely happy
2036	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	ok phone if you want a named brand in this price range this and moto g are your options i chose this phone for my wife because shes a selfie  addict there were many lesser known brand phones available that would offer better value for your money but in named brands this is a ok phone to have theres nothing spectacular about this phone so if youre not too demanding and want a named brand that everyone would know go for this some major niggles i found with the phone is that the screen resolution is not that great my wifes previous phone a xolo had better screen resolution then this phone the phone also dont support autolockunlock feature with the flip cover so youll always have to press the power button to turn the screen on to see any notification that brings to another point the phone doesnt have any notification light to let you know if its charging properly or if you have received any messages her previous 8k xolo phone had that the phone appears as if its 5534 phablet but the screen size is 534 with on screen navigation keys eating into that real estate i would rather have the touch buttons on the bazle itself so the screen remains clear of any such distractions i fail to understand how a big brand like htc has so many omissions in a product that is meant to address the 12k14k market
2037	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	htc desire 620g is a budget 5inch phone featuresthe desire 620g runs android 44 kitkat not the latest 50 lollipop but this is forgivable on a budget phone htc has slapped its sense 6 interface over the top so it wont look much different to most of htcs recent phones  including the flagship one m8 i like sense 6 as its quite strippeddown and easy to use its also mercifully free of all the preinstalled bloatware youll find on android phones from samsung or sonyhtcs blinkfeed news aggregator sits off to the left of the homescreens pulling in content from your favourite news outlets and your social network accounts its quite handy seeing things in one place but you can get rid of blinkfeed if youre not keen powering the phone is a 12ghz qualcomm snapdragon 401 quadcore processor with 1gb of ram which should be sufficient to give a reasonably smooth experience theres a 2100mah battery which id hope will be able to give a full day of use but ill be putting this to the test in the full review on the back of the phone is an 8megapixel camera with a 5megapixel camera on the front again ill be testing these when i spend some quality time with the phone it is a nice phone but it does not have the latest version of android so i give it 4 stars
2038	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	beauty of a phonefrom the looks of it to the performance you cant blame this wonderful product at this pricesuper sleeklarge crystal clear screen they camera is just awesomeesp the front takes hi quality selfiesui is also nothing to complain abouttouch is only two point though one may get the impression tat the 1 gb ram cant handle thingsbut it does so incredibly and 98 of the time fone doesnt lag battery backup is nominalcomes for a whole day vth optimum usagebut the thing of wonder about the battery is the speed of chargingjust 15 hrs from 15100 the things you may worry glossy back cover a tad low volumes no great headphones its just simplenot for the music maniac tho 4 gb internal that u get from the 8gb total finally its the best cute phone for those who want a branded smartphone at a nominal price just the perfect smartphone below 15k 128077 amazon service is fantastic as ever
2039	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	nice product i got it from amazonin last month it delivered within the time mentioned pros 1 performance is faster 2 display quality is very good 3 superfast with 17 ghz octacore processor and 1gb ram 4 look and feel is good 5 8gb onboard memory cons 1 sound quality is not good sound is very very less 2 camera quality is not good enough as compared to other vendors mobile with same mp   camera is good in day light not so good in night 3 earphone is too bad and not usable at all 4 the phone is glossy it catches fingerprints and scratches easily 5 flash light does not provide enough light 6 every time you unlock the phone the google search app starts automatically it is annoying to close it again and again
2040	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	what a phone that a price point of 13k  it is worth the money amazing camera pics looks so real time gliding the screen is great and even battery life is gr8 only thing is that it uses micro sim so have to get my sim cut at local shop  but i guess all phones soon are moving to microsim now added 8gb of storage and have option to move data to sd card now design as usual htc waygr8 sleek look best phone in 1013k category
2041	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	good phone the casing is a fingerprint magnet find a better casing if you dont like excessive finger prints the camera is super cool for the price i paid i was searching for a phone thats better than moto g second gen in terms of display and camera i am very happy with this battery lasts a day the charger cable is only half the size of its peers but it does what i want just another happy amazon customer
2042	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	great phone 1  but the internal memory was described as 8gb but here i found it 4gb  also i didnt knew that i would have to cut the sim to fit is in 
2043	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	hello amazonians this is my third day with this phone bought from local store  pros  1 android kitkat 442 2 sharp hd display 3 great camera and sharp images front 5mp rear 8mp with anti glare glass 4 superfast with 17 ghz octacore processor and 1gb ram 5 good battery backup with 2100mah capacity 6 8gb onboard memory but only 4 gb available user memory 7 front facing loudspeaker as per spec on various sites they say it has stereo speakers but only lower speaker works when phone rings and you play music 8 torch and file manager preinstalled 9 phone doesnt heat up 10 looks and feel is good  cons  1 the phone is glossy it catches fingerprints and scratches easily and may slip out of hand 2 you cant remove sim cards and sd card without removing the battery 3 headphone audio quality is not that good until you adjust equalizer and volume level is low 4 lcd display contrast ratio under sunlight is questionable 5 there is no notification led 6 ui is a mixture of htc sense and stock android some sense ui features are missing as compared with my desire x 7 loudspeaker doesnt have boom sound  summary you can go for this phone if the cons dont matter to you however currently yureka and redmi note and lenovo a6000 are much better options overall looks specifications and performance is impressive
2044	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	if u want to a selfie phone this one is the best for this budgetthe htc touch is smooth and one of the best  pros   good display 720p and 294ppi  decent gpu and processor  better pair of cameras at this price point  good battery backuplast a full day  great set of front speakersexcellent sound clarity  cons   glossy back panelquiet slippery  not the latest android not the best for extreme graphics play only 8gb internals can be expanded though as far as android is concerned apps cant be fully moved to sd cardso 8gb is quiet less no beats audio
2045	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	using for mor than a month now very nice phone at this price cons first low on volume when playing music no notification light cannot move apps to mmc pros great camera nice display light compared to size good processor  battery backup
2046	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	htc is giving you quality experience in such an affordable price  just to let everyone know the ui is a combination of htc sense and stock android as many are confused on this awesome camera both front  back great processor believe me u ll feel the the octa core working when u use it hd games plays without a single glitch good headphone sound but little thumbs down on the speaker sound vol is a bit low although it is pretty descent all in all a great phone  and amazon guys are awesome on delivery process got the phone on the third day
2047	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	the phone is good overall except for the following issues  1 loud speaker quality is very bad almost impossible to call on loudspeaker mode music without headphone is also not good 2 every time you unlock the phone the google search app starts automatically it is annoying to close it again and again 3 though the phone is fast it takes too much time to open some apps may be it is the fault of those apps  but i am happy with the sound quality in headphone and while calling speed of the processor though i am using it only for a month now screen resolution camera quality both front and the back good phone within this budget
2048	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	nice product my wife using htc desire 526g plus which was having battery heating issue this product has eliminated that issue value for money delivered early than expected best price compare to electronic showrooms
2049	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	i have been using this product from 2 months this is not a htc phone it is just a cheap chinese piece with all chinese parts this phone is made for the specs to look attractive but every part of it is cheap the camera doesnt have clarity and takes no light in darkness or even in light it doesnt take details from dark coloured objects it is very difficult to take a picture without blur you cant see the screen in sun full of light reflection overall the phone looks cheap to hold with backside easy to get scratches on the glossy plastic even though it is octacore processor the phone lags it takes more than a second to show caller id while you get a caller id until then it shows blank screen similarly the multitask button lags sometimes the screen wont respond to slight touches that you expect it to respond the screen easily catches your sweat even though you wont get much the screen gets spoiled in a day atleast with sweat in room temperatures i dont have sweaty hands sound quality is not great i hyderabad if you connect to vodafone 3g it shows roaming it is the problem with few phones this is one of it no other phone is showing so with the same sim card inserted i resetted the phone and downloaded exact settings etc before i came to know such an issue exists vibration device in this phone is the worst which i got very irritated battery is ok until you reach 35 after than it reduces suddenly to 9 and then 3 except for the specs to read everything is worse  the only pro for this phone is i dropped it twice from 6 feet high on a flat surface it did not break nor shown any dents or marks
2050	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	best phone for this price range excellent specs for 12k13k range phone again very good service from amazon if the specs fullfil your needs then buy this phone it is absolute value for money
2051	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	awesome phone at awesome price i have been using every kind of phone such as motosamsungetc just find that htc new interface is very good phone looks smart camera clarity is unbeatable at the end of the day size does matters just the one small problem isof speaker volume is kind of low and only one speaker is on the lower side the upper one is just grill thats makes me unhappy from such a wonderful company and phone i was not expecting such cost cutting by just giving one speaker and two grill last but not least you will get the least price for this phone on amazoncom only not a local dealer or evan flipkart
2052	HTC Desire 620G (Dual SIM, Milkyway Grey)	its an amazing phone with great features n long battery life though you upload too many appshtc desire 620g never gets slow down  i think one must have htc desire 620g if want to have a real smartphone

2054	Micromax Canvas Fire 4 A107 (Cosmic Grey)	i have not purchased this product from amazon but from a mobile shop in the neighborhood  currently micromax canvas spark is being sold by snapdeal in flash sale for rs 4999 this phone is similar to micromax canvas spark for lot of features where this is better than spark is the dual front stereo speakers and that is the reason for the higher cost but this comes only with 45 inch 480x854 pixel screen while the spark comes with 47 inch 540x960 pixel screen this phone also comes with dual flash  there is a backlight with micromax punch logo and in the default setting lights up draining the battery unnecessarily and it can be switched off to conserve the battery  the charger is a 700 ma charger and it takes more than 3 hours to charge the non removeable 2000 mah battery  this phone comes with android 5 lollipop the capacitive keys are android kitkat key images and not lollipop images

2094	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	i have been a fan of htc and had an opportunity to test this mobile thru my friend this seems a power house and the display instantly caught my attention the movies played was at its best i could see the octacore performance wherein the video rendering was at par with the best available the phone itself was a little bulky to my hands but any 55 incher will weigh this much this had a high capacity card and media access was very smooth the speakers and audio from earphones were crisp i had no complains
2095	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	bought this phone around 40 days back at first everything went well but just on 27th june i discovered phones touch nit functioning properly found out that htc has only two service centers in delhi when i visited kamla nagar service center i found out two other people had same problems with the same phone and they had also purchased their phones around the same time service center staff was even worse and wanted to keep my phone for a repair for 25 days i called up customer service and after much persuasion that other people here are also facing exact same issue thry agreed to replace my phone however told me it will take 48 hrs for approval and once done i willagain have to come to sservice center to get doa i am waiting since and its been 4 days and it hasnt been sorted i keep getting told that they have raised request for approval and its pending but nobody wants to do anything i just keep getting told to wait 48 hrs more everytime i call even their facebook page have received compaints for the same phoneproblem nobody cares to look into this guys consider yourselves warned
2096	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	on first two days i used this mobile vigorously by using power drainings apps and games like real racing 3 and lots of unwanted apps  which resulted into phone getting heated a bit battery lasting only 6 hrs  but once am back to normal usage and remove all unwanted apps and stop the vigorous testing the phone is great i still play real racing 3 battery discharge seems to ok but for normal usage and daily few hours of 3g and continuous wifi  sync also seems to be fine  at first front camera seems to slightly blurred once you get a hang on taking picture without shaking even seems fine i like both camera qualities the way shoot is quite fast disable review mode all you have do is tap the screen to take a pic or video  themes are awesome which i miss from nseries day  i really like this phones design am happy with this phone 4 star is fair rating
2097	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	the device is really good 1 display is good sunlight visibility could have been better 2 surprised to see camera features like slomo  fastmotion hd present in the device 3 the boom sound feature was not that great on this device 4 headphones are better than the other htc desire phones they are inear canal shape i guess and the sound quality is also very good
2098	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	i have been using htc desire 826 for a week now i gotta tell u d phone looks great a bit bigger for my liking but works smoothly buttery experience till now both cams are great  batterly lasts a day android lollipop works well ht sense interface is good too videos look great on full hd screen sound quality is amazing  wid boomsound speakers and earphones are better than earpods in apple no heating yet even after playing asphalt 8 brothers in arms overall very happy wid investment packing could have been better though but service was fast

2101	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	the phone is good has bright screeni would recommend it if anyone wants a phone in 2025k range pros 1 octa core 213 mp front camera which gives you expectional selfie 3hd screen 4dual sim 516 gb internal memory 6brand name 34htc34 hence you can expect good service post purchasing cons 1on continuous usage heats up like frying pan well this normal for every octa core smartphone 2battery drains out quickly when using wifi about amazon service you better buy fast because it vanishes quickly from the website and you have to wait some more daysthe person delivering the phone called me before coming this was a good thing as in was able to schedule the delivery according to my comfort and do not have to stay at home the whole day waiting for it
2102	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	the most pathetic experience for buying htc desire 826 the touch stopped working within seven days of purchasing and the heights is that they denied the bill as i had purchased from flipkart is this the way to deal with the customers and on what basis are they selling this product if the touch and the speakers are of third quality never ever recommed any one to go for htc what is the fault of the customer if the deals between the flipkart and htc people  is inappropriate
2103	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	i got this wonderful stuff a week agovalue for your every rupeeexcellent quality pics by back and front cameragreat sound with duel front speakershigh clarity displaygood performance with octa core processorsand 2gb rambattery stands for one day it is okheating usual as other smart phonessize is big i feel some dificulty to keep phone in pocketotherwise it is a great phone if you hav some bucks go for it

2106	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	amazing smartphone and excellent performance in display processing powerultra speed usage  if you are in a need for good cam mobile with excellent ui and stylish mobile with light speed processing then go for itbut you have to sacrifice few hours of batter backup  lasts 5 hours on continuous usage and 12 hours on light usage 
2107	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	good one with some minor issues over all you  love it heats up very fast and battery drains a bit quicker than usuall  heating issues are because of processor i think i saw all other phones with the same processor heats up quickly  cameragamingaudiodispaly is good gaming is  fine overall it passed in distinction
2108	HTC Desire 826 (Dual SIM, Blue Lagoon)	good build quality looks awesome sounds quality is good but not loud performance wise its also good but some in house apps are useless and u cant even remove them before this i am using moto g and i think they had better user interface pure android 50 is much better than customized in htc

2120	Lenovo S850 (Dark Blue)	this phone has good speed its screen navigation is good but i has two issues  if network changes many times it doesnot detect the network it needs to restart againif there is no attention on phone i miss some important calls it also happens if there is low network  its contact manager does get slow and it takes more time to search the contacts and make calls

2136	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	my cousin owns this phone and at first it looked and worked good everything was working fine with no lags but after installing some applications the phone starts to show its real face  the processor it ships with is a 1 ghz cortexa5 qualcomm msm7227a snapdragon the main problem is not due to the phone getting out of memoryrather due to this low end processor on board combined with the heavy touchwiz user interface one of the issues he faced is sometimes when an incoming call comessound is heardbut the screen goes unresponsive and you cant take the call  it lags a lot during multi tasking toolaunching apps can sometimes take agesthe camera quality is not that good  the android version it ships with is very old  android 40 icecream sandwich  this is not a value for money product for sure  you can get better performing quadcore devices for this price range with 1 gb rambetter gpucamera and batterynot a value for money device

2138	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	the display went kaput in just a week of purchase the service center wanted one month to change the display and the best part was this phone was gifted to one of our friends by me and my wife samsung surely has dropped its quality in both products and service and this is the second phone in 2 years we have moved out from the samsung family of products the good thing about all this is the shopping experience with amazon if we had got this product from a store i surely would not have got a replacement or my money back and we would have been embarrassed as this was a gift for someone i really appreciate the effort of amazon in helping us with this issue and the experience shopping with these guys was an awesome feeling  thank you team a jason
2139	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	i have used this phone personally and seriously with the pace the mobile market is growing this phone can never compete with other company phones in this price range firstly it has got pretty old version of android ie android 41 jelly bean  versions of android before android 44 kitkat need 1gb ram but this one has only 512 mb ram so expect this phone to hang even when you just open the box of the phone  secondly it has got pretty slow and outdated processor 1 ghz processor cant handle heavy apps of these days so thats a big drawback too expect a lag as soon as you install one or two extra apps in it
2140	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	bad this phone has only one core the ram is only 512 mb lags at almost every single time i use it to be honest this phone has no pros a few weeks after using it the phone had a black patch on it which kept growing the service centre people were also unhelpful even though it was only a few weeks old they asked 4000 rupees for repairing the screen 4000 rs for a 5000 rupees phone this phone is utter crap and nothing more than a paper weight never make the mistake of buying it there are a lot better phones than this in this price range
2141	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	i have been using this phone since a year this phone is good if you are not going to use any applications additionally otherwise this phone is very slow if you installed even any 3 apps memory 512 mb and 1 ghz processor is completely not enough as of now in the technology world mic is very bad in the past year i have given this phone for mic issue 3 to 4 times to samsung service center even all the parts has been changed including board itself still my phone mic issue is not resolved 2 mp camera is good as for this capacity
2142	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	i bought my amazing set 9 months ago it started well everything went smoothly but now my phone has gone crazy the touch works on its own and sometimes it doesnt work at all when the touch works on its own random tabs and applications open and close the shutter falls down and then goes up icons get selected search boxes get filled with crap like 34627gstwvsjxhdjwskj34 one day i plugged the charger in and went to kitchen to help my mom this bastard started playing porn thats embarrassing in fact to write this review through my phone it took me 4 unsuccessful attempts and 43 minutes  and its been just nine months this phone is so bad that people are not ready to buy it second hand at 1000 rupees they ask for a flip cover and earpieces along with a three months free trial in addition someone kindly tell me how to give a zero star
2143	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	55k for this phone is simply to drain your pocketputting in a 1000 rs more will fetch u descend smartphones with far better specs still its featuring a 2mp camera without a flash 65k ul get moto e different models of micromax canvas n alleven the underdog sony e1 wil do far better than this senseless pricingjs to trap common man with some superficial touchups n a 4 screen if u r tat particular of wasting ur money u may go for it orelse think
2144	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	this phones battery drains so fast i am really irritated now  dont buy this phone  i bought these phones black and white  for my parents battery drains so fast  i cant even return this piece to them  bcoz they give 10 days policy to return if there is damage  or defective  so i would suggest dont buy this phone
2145	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	my brother in law was in need of a good handset and samsung star pro was a good choice thanks to amazonin for good offers timely delivery and safe payments for this product the good thing about this mobile is that its by samsung so no worry of performance and touch its good to go for beginners on android platform
2146	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	the worst phone i have bought when there is an incoming call the screen is showing to swipe but i cant swipe to accept the call heats up without no reason very slow and hangs every moment touch response is also not very good battery is worse  howeverthe sound quality is fine
2147	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	i like this product which is a budget samsung galaxy series it has every thing it needs i strongly recommend this to people who are not looking for gaming phones
2148	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	this phone not for long time use big problem this set is down in hand with minm hight screen broken
2149	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	this is not good mobile get i have order on amezon but not sand me a good mobile or pen drive
2150	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	battery is worst it gets discharge very quickly and touch screen is also not affective
2151	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	if you are looking for a good budget android smartphone this is the phone for you not going into specifics here like only 2mp camera no 3g because its a budget smart phone well worth its price as usual delivered on time and good service
2152	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	it looks quite expensive and its display is bright too it looks good but it does not perform well it has got very less ram about 450 mb so it shows a lot of lag and sometimes while using some apps the screen goes black and the app crashes
2153	Samsung Galaxy Star Pro GT-S7262 (White)	phone is very good but donot buy it from amzon  you will never get your product on time  but delay with 4 5 days  with the pathetic service of amazon   flipkart is better than this  wahiyat service provider 
2154	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	before writing this review i used this handset for approximately six months i had migrated from blackberry curve so it took time to get used to the touch screen keyboard i was skeptical about the user experience but the os is very intuitive some of the pros are  1 no need of bis service ie monthly saving of rs 950 per month 2 good screen resolution 3 can run most of the android apps i have been using using camscanner candy crush google maps etc without any problem 4 push mail is at par with bes service faster than ios and androidmails comes to phone before outlook in pc 5 typing is sooth like silk nothing beats blackberry i have tried android but i still swear by blackberry 6 as expected this is work horse all mails sms alerts etc can be accessed at one single location 34hub34 from any app just swipe and you are in hub and check mails text alerts etc 7 camera is good not best but does decent job after os 103 upgrade new features has been added 8 contact manager is amazing it updates contacts photographs from facebook twitter linkedin etc from your connected apps 9 anything can be shared from share icon to lots of connected apps like bbm whatsapp viber facebook twitter linkedin mail bluetooth wifi direct etc 10 bbm has been enhanced and has some of the best features 11 apps maker have recognized bb and have started providing apps and features to blackberry as well whatsapp calling features rolled out to just after android 12 entire os look is very polished years ahead of android 13 battery life is amazing one full charge lasts for 15 days in 2g connection with apps like bbm whatsapp viber news reader evernote linkedin twitter facebook dropbox box feedly pushbullet running all the time 14 blackberry blend is amazing another first from blackberry you can check mails reply to mails calendars of your phone and much more from your pc ipad or android tablet without compromising data security 15 if bes plan is activated you can have your work and personal profile separate 16 audio player is good and can play most of the file format it also plays flac music format as well supplied earphone is nice and better than of moto g and sony though i am using over the ear headphone 17 through wifi direct data can be shared with devices in same network 18 can play video or audio to your tv through miracast no need to add any third party apps 19 internal memory is of 8 gb os takes about 53 gb 20 media card is expandable till 32 gb this is what i have used i have not tried 64 gb 21 built in parental control using wich you can control applications and features and sites which child should not access 22 bulit in amazon app store to download and install android apps if you want to install android apps from google play store then use snap for the same 23 use lucky patchers to patch android apps asking for google playstore connection 24 can browse network files through built in file manager 25 5 inch screen good for reading ebooks in kindle app reading pdf files 26 native map is better than google maps 27 device is very secured and for security paranoid like me picture 28 all notifications is visible in  homescreen when locked you need not unlock the phone to peep into mails text or alerts 29 amazing and secure built in password manager 30 for reminders built in app remember is really amazing you can add anything really anything to it 31 virus and malware free  cons  1 sharp edges should have been a bit rounded 2 sharing large files with android or ios uses through xender super beam etc not possible i tried so may times through wifi direct this can be done 3
2155	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	considered this phone just because i am bored of android and windows phone android was very usual and very common windows phone was refreshing but the limitations were annoying having used both i wanted something different inbetween android and windows phone and i got it and i am loving it bb 1021 is really cool i am not a app centric phone user i wanted a way to manage facebook whatsapp emails textmessages in a easier way and found out bb10 has bb hub which is what i wanted all these days i am not sure if android has such an option to handle all the messaging stuffs at one place without even having to open the respective apps but windows phone didnt have it the bb hub toast messages lockscreen noticfication quicksettings picture password battery backup z3 with 2500 mah bb keyboard etc are the real strength of bb 10 hatsoff for blackberry for such nice thoughts the build of the phone really needs a mention it is solid premium and beautiful people who didnt know about the z3 didnt believe the price  they expected somewhere around 25k they were really shocked to know such a phone for so less price i am yet to try android apps sideloading  though the os is a wow it keeps you wish for more one such example is there is no select all option anywhere in the menus of email pictures music or whereever though select many option is there but that is understandable the platform is totally new and blackberry is rolling out worthy updates in frequent intervals which is a positive sign  i would recommend this phone for people who are not much into apps wants a bigger screen well organised social messaging longer battery life and a beautiful phone in hand go for blackberry z3
2156	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	hope useful if u want the brand go for itgood in performance  but poor if compare with other mobilesmy opinion up to my experience for this costit is the best mobilegreat thing is supports androidwhen i purchased it it was with basic os version works superbafter 2months it shown that new version of os is availableafter installing the new os problems started hanging for long time and continuously charging also not as previousapps are not getting open for every app it was showing error and closing the app mobile also getting heatafter  10min continuous usage camera is good while talking with third person we can hear the voice clearly but they cant hear our voice speaker is  not up to brand just ok battery  may be ok now a days heating problem is common for all mobiles  already had mobile then dont go for updated os  but still i had a doubt that while it was showing blackberry 10 while shutting down and starting the mobile  all the users of blackberry z 3 please advice me 1 is this possible to change the os to basic version of os 2 possible to open back cover  dont go for fully covered pouchesit may be safe to phone but some pouches causing heat irritation to body when you kept in pocketwhen mobile heated it abstracting the air contact to the phone
2157	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	i am using this phone for more then 10 months bought it after through research but reality what i experienced is different to what is in blogs and websites here are some things to consider before you buy this phone no bullsht only criticism on merit 1 blackberry app store have very few utility apps except few all the apps are paid 2 you can install apk files android apps from amazon app store but android apps dont work properly those works have limited functionality 3  important it heats up so much while using apps on 3g data or while browsing google blackberry z3 heating issue this makes me sometimes so irritated that i feel like i should throw it now 4 amazon app store dose not have apps like instagram and 8 ball pool very few apps which you can use both the stores of blackberry cant provide any app to lock your message or gallery 5 short charging cable of only 15 inches approx 6 bad camera in low light shot  but good battery stylish phone but only if you want to spend a lot of money on apps i choose it among many phones read many blogs and reviews but am disappointed but i cant change it and have to use it with all this drawbacks
2158	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	blackberry8217s server related internet connectivity and the exorbitant data charges prevented me always from buying a device i am so happy that blackberry 10 devices now allow internet access through service providers data plans like any other android or iphone  this will surely push the sales and make the models an instant success  about my z3 i like this phone for its hassle free operation and stylish look reasonably priced with a qualcomm snapdragon 400 processor with integrated adreno 305 graphics and a generous 15gb of ram this is the best device available for the price tag  go and grab one today
2159	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	hey guysthis phone is very cheap of blackberry os and i updated to recent os 10311779 it is soo gud to useand one thing is the phone gets heating all the time and camera quality is tooo bad
2160	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	prons 1first of all its an awesome phone in blackberry category 2battery is awesome 3stylish 4graphic is good 5if your are looking for a mobile under 13k range then blindly go for this  cons 1touch screen is not up to the mark 2some times it hangs 3less free apps in blackberry world
2161	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	love the device from first sight awesome keyboard wonderful hub have heating issues the device gets heated up slightly within ten minutes also device is not for app lovers battery capacity is high but doesnt seem to stay long im slightly upset about the heating issue apart from that its a fine mobile will try to give a detailed write up after a month or so
2162	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	phone is simply amazing earlier i was using bold 9780 and i was confused whether to buy this phone or not as it doesnt have qwerty keypad but with this phone new keyboard pattern typing is so easy blackberry hub is another cool feature you may have look at all your messages at single place
2163	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	hello all for who going to buy bb z3 i am sincerely suggesting you dont buy this product from bb i was bought it before 7 months and read my problems with this product 1 my friend told me to not to buy from amazon i ignored it 2 this is useful for who is familiar with bb and who has circle using bb 3 all android apps wont support even with amazon store 4 its just like basic phone for who dont know how to use it coming to performance 5 some times suddenly will hang 6 battery worst worst worst bcz without internet battery will drain fast compared to express train and with internet bullet train so for who unable to keep charge often dont buy it  its my true exp
2164	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	pros an awesome phone i love it processor is very good user interface is mind blowing battery life is nice even you keep browing on net chatting on whats up replying to your office mail it can give you whole day battery support if you buy this phone its sure you will not miss any your office communication you will love to reply your office mail through blackberry hub yeah the blackberry hub is a feature that any busy businessman would love to have in his phone cons only thing it lacks is a good rear camera camera quality is not up to the mark it takes time to click in night otherwiseif you are not selfie mania this phone is good for working person
2165	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	blackberry should be number one contender in the market i have never seen this type of phone in my life ever firstly amazon services are great from their other competitors because they delivered the product such a way that is really amazing my ideas works differently my experience is really long in computers usage from years  years but when we talk about phone migration into mini computers ie is different thing now i can say that i can classified every phone in depth actually number one is blackberry operating system in all booting operating systems this phone designed such a way that even in low configuration model this works perfectly but fast and manufacturing company also delivered super duper services by updating phone models regularly no one can believe this but this is true that this phone works perfectly in even dual core processor like a octa core one although i am not tested this phone in gaming mode but internet surfing is incredible from very first day and i surely told you that anyone  forget pc after using blackberry after this finally number two is apple in quality but they offered two much costly phones without water resistant if we compare marketing strategy for 4 operating system models for mobile phones android actually making fool by providing lollipop to everyone because thats the another matter that blackberry company is not able to resist their footsteps in the market financially but technically they are very solid overall anyone can say that android is a free version and does not able to provide full performance of phone even if your phone is loaded with snapdragon 825 latest processor with tons of ram whats the benefit for taking phone with advanced configuration if your base is not solid apple is very costly windows has third number in operating system and now a days you can say this works fine windows phones are average phone with good user experience android is baseless have no level between these big competitors so rethink before purchasing any phone in future if anyone think that i am wrong you can test yourself and prove your knowledge about phone against me
2166	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	purchased this mobile 2 months backworking good initially there was problem with bbm it was consuming more battery and mobile was getting heated problem was solved by restarting the device same problem happened 4 to 6 times and was solved the same way few days back same problem appeared doesnt know the reason why this happens beside these  every thing is ok hub is excellentmailing is good and easy battery backup is good camera is not satisfactory amazon delivered my blackberry z3 within 22 hrs without any extra pay good service amazom
2167	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	after using the phone for nearly 2 months here is my feedbackobservations overall the phone is value for its price with some exceptions one major issue i observed many times was the call gets automatically disconnected while you are phone another issue observed was the phone book sometimes behaves very wierdly when we search for a particular contact and dial that contact the call will go to a different contact this is very embarassing sometime as the call will reach to a different person instead of the intended person
2168	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	good phone atleast better then most android phones sturdy enough needs a bit upgradation in terms of hardware and software updates as the os uprade part is very slow and not good sometimes due to regular use the phone might get hot or have some software issues camera is so so call quality is excellent blackberry hub is handy and useful  overall a good phone and it would be best if blackberry takes competition seriously and come up with better hardware and some software updates to make this phone having a better market share
2169	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	this phone is worth buyingonly its difficult to find a flip cover or back case in any storeeven at the blackberry retail showroomother than that it is worth buying
2170	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	i dont think its price suits the quality hope we can get better mobile in market for 12000 rs also the head set they have provided is very bad battery is reducing when we use internent services in mobile but it is ok when i hear songs over all i dont think its not the best phone for my investment people who choose branded phones may go for this
2171	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	using this handset since 6 months first thing is camera picture not so clear if you see moto g picture you can find the difference second concern is battery back up whatever given in specification about battery back up not up to the markit only gives 1012 hours back up in 3g networkmight be due to android installed apps most of the android apps compatible with z3 we hope in next  1 or 2 months improved bb 103 os will be released so hence all small small issues will be resolved overall good phone
2172	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	awesome fone fast processing elegant looks good amount of ram android apps supportcan install apks directlyi was bored of using the android and wanted to try a blackberry so bought from amazon in a deal on 1111 at the lowest price  i could find ever with a return policy by amazon but injust 2 days of its use i started liking and then eventually loving it i am happy with my upgrade from a usual android to a blackberry not to forget its battery of 2500 ah is awesome and lasts for 2 days at times
2173	BlackBerry Z3 (Black)	gem of a phone with all the concerns around android notwithstanding blackberry manages to score on all the relevant metrics touch is as smooth as any other phone looks gorgeous there is absolutely no lag when you swipe your way through the applications and the best part is that using apk downloader website you can run all your android apps on blackberry os as well wihout any technical hiccups its been over 2 weeks since i got my hands on this phone and its been an amazing experience thus far
2174	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	cool phone to use and with a minimum budget user friendly good charge back up  excellent features from ram to everythingfull satisfiedcan buy this without hesitation
2175	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	world class feature and performance touch  5 star sound  5 star screen resolution  3 star performance  4 star battery  4 star ui  5 star
2176	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	windows phone 128241 are better than android in speed smoothness and many more features why to buy 1 dual sim 2 windows phone 3 in built office apps 4superb camera 128247  dont hesitate as it is 5mp  better than 10 mp of any other company 5 fast internet over android  cones 1 front camera 2 flash though you wont need it  best thing  best in class for the price tag
2177	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	i didnt get this from amazon but here goes the review  lumia 630 has a number of advantages going for it but the first thing that struck me is the aesthetics of the device its like looking at the next iphone c the device has no skeuomorphic elements like fake leather stitches of brushed metal finish thats actually thin plastic and its a single piece of pc shell that wraps around the front bezel the back is beautifully curved with a bold sharp edge on all sides that makes the side profile of the phone surprisingly thin and is a good design choice the plastic is however a little creaky at times with the rest of the phone but dirt and grime wipe off easily i got the white one for myself the front is pure black thanks to clearblack technology and seamlessly blends with the black bezel which makes the device seem more worthy than its price add to it gorilla glass 3 the display size is pretty optimized for onehand use as is the size of the phone itself  coming to the performance the quadcore snapdragon 400 flies through most tasks the limiting factor in some cases being the meager 512mb memory but they are sufficient enough for versatile uses and i could hardly notice any lags in my daytoday use  battery life is moderately good and gives a days run at single charge the charging is however painfully slow the display produced good contrast and rich vivid colors the one area it lacks is the runofthemill resolution but thats granted for a budget device reading books in kindle was an enjoyable experience as was watching a movie in some intensive tasks the device does get pretty warm but not hot by any means camera quality leaves something to be desired for coming from another lumia but for the budget android demographic should be pretty terrific i personally never used the flash that much and i dont find the omission that glaring nokia also cut some corners by omitting the twostage camera shutter key and hardware buttons while im in great displeasure with the former the latter one performs as good as the physical ones i had before another thing worth noting youll find the lack of a ambient light sensor much more frustrating than a proximity sensor because the displayoffwhenputtoear works like magic  as for the software wp 81 is a significant improvement upon wp8 and brings some parity to it with ios and android the device packs lumia cyan firmware out of the box too action center is the one feature i found myself using the most followed by battery sense xbox musicvideo still look like unoptimized pieces of bloatware but at least theyre updating it biweekly live tiles work flawlessly as do toast notifications switching between the two networks of the two sim cards is a breeze and is very organized the option of saving apps to the memory card is welcomed too  in short this is a phone youd desire if you find yourself looking at the boring app drawer all day this is a very modern stylish device that has a lot of points going for it the least of which is its attractive price the downsides are of course the ecosystem lack of google services and a frontfacing camera or maybe the camera flash
2178	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	the mobile is really good  1 the screen is nice but little black edges are clearly visible 2 the apps are less but they are of better quality although improvement is desired in easy to use and langauge support 3 voice support is not there which is desired at such competitive market 4 here maps are good and they are offline the best part 5 camera is awesome in daylight outdoor pics but not good in dark areas 6 voice clarity and signal reception is good well i am using mostly it in indoor places 7 not a game lover but most of games are running without lag 8 the phone really never hangs on 512mb amazing  with 16 gb samsung memory card but with 64 gb memory card it was like hell not a single application was running smoothly why  whey they say it supports 128 gb memory card wasted my hard earned 2000 rupees for that memory card 9 the design and features are good pretty slim phone  but missing the camera button on right edge 10 most of the famous apps whats app facebook etc are running without lag 11 a flash is desired in the camera for better pics in the indoors 12 can play most of the video and audio formats but improvement is needed in the player apps for dat files so that we can play the movies directly 13 much better than laggy android phones 14 the default storage sense musicaudio player  app is not good so i down loaded other 34files34 for managing files 15 mix radio is good 16 live tiles is great 17 with 45 inch screen it is easy to hold and grip 18 the screen is protected by gg3 but highly vulnerable to finger prints smudges 19 if not require flash and front camera go for it as it is the best phone with  that price tag and great brand nokia lumia does not look cheap while holding
2179	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	received a demo phone from amazon scratched my head for a week trying to understand why there are some basic options like setting up phone lock password and some other stuffs not enabledthe contact list having some unknown names in itwhich u cant removeand all such weird stuffsthen finally took it to nokia carewhere the guy asked whr did u get this phone fromits not meant for saleits a phone used for demothts why demo version is installed in this wasnt expecting such experience from amazonthanks to nokia care who atleast reinstalled the fresh software and now its working fine
2180	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	the new nokia lumia 630 is the bst phn i have evr seen within the budget of a student belonging to a middle class family it is the 1st trustable model to provide windows 81 in a considerble price bt the only 2 demerits of this is 1 it dont have flash in the camera 2 it dont have primary camera not at all suitable for video calling bt its 5 mp secondary camera gives awsum clarity in day light
2181	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	the sound system was crashed down in day 2 due to which i had to return the piece its completely a nokia problem thanks to amazon refunding my money
2182	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	if u need a daily life smart windows phonethen u should definitely  go for itits amazingnever hangsplay games nice camera for casual clicking awesum price and a smart buy
2183	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	i placed order for the phone on 28th january 2015  received the same on 3rd february 2015 the phone has started malfunctioning within a month of delivery the problem is that when a call is made or received on it the voice totally breaks down  nothing could be heard on either side the call has to be disconnected again and again hampering communication i have tried using different sim from my airtel one but results have not improved simply hate amazon and its products
2184	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	except the 5mp camera and no front camera there is nothing i can complain about the screen is brilliant especially when i compare it with the 520 and 720
2185	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	i own this for past 3 months and so far im loving it before anyone takes a 34fanboy34 impression let me clarify that i was an advanced user on android platform for a long long time i juiced the max from the droid seeing it change from gingerbread all the way to kitkat but via cyanogen aosp and a couple of other roms that were available for that phone so im being unbiased in my review  before you buy the device ask three questions to yourself 1 are you buying a budget phone with fast and simple ui being a priority 2 are you ready to pay for apps instead of scam off the pirated ones 3 are you ready to get adjusted to a new ui  if you answered yes to the three questions look no further windows phone 81 update 1 has brought the os to a new level from  an os point of view it is light on the hardware heck i never had any crash or hang on my set but i did have a bit of lag issue which was resolved after the recent update as well as the battery assuming you dont opt for developer preview as they are still buggy and not release worthy yet so occasional updates can reduce it a bit not the case with the normal update channel though works like a charm a common cry about the platform is cry for 34no apps34 which i believe is stupid you will find almost all of the useful apps or at least a replacement app to fill up the time the actual ones get ported in point of games however it is not the same though the scene is rapidly improving the games collection on windows platform is still pretty bad but you have the ones like asphalt 8 pvz cut the rope temple run series and a bunch of other popular titles  coming down to this phone in particular here is my review  build  brilliant build quality the phone feels pretty good to hold everything fits on nicely no funny sounds on normal stress the phone feels a tad bit heavy but not that much to worry about either the plastic body feels well built and strong ive dropped the phone on the road during heavy rain and it survived to tell the tale without even a scratch frankly i was very impressed seeing that  performance  one thing to remember is it is a budget smartphone not a gaming phone as long as you remember that you will never be disappointed in fact you will be pretty amazed with its performance when compared to most droids in its price range 9k when i bought it the snapdragon 400 provides a good overall performance and though the 512mb ram may feel low on paper it is more than enough for pretty much all the tasks you throw at it gaming on the device however is decent at most asphalt runs without a lag after the last update now but the detail level sucks its a compromise they made so if you will be gaming more on the smartphone than actually use the 34smart34 functionality of the phone look elsewhere however if smartphone is what you are looking for this is definitely worth a look  software  other than my view about the os mentioned earlier some other noteworthy packages that come preinstalled on the phone are cortana the virtual assistant trust me she is super useful if used properly can greatly improve the productivity fell in love with this one ms office with lync and exchange for the it folks to be connected nokia camera package a whole bunch of 34lens34 you can use each having something unique here maps offline maps storage with life time free navigation one of my fav part of the phone the lock time is 6010s mixradio free for a month has a subscription plan after it really cool app to get customized playlists from real users rather than program suggestions  camera  its no secret that nokia was leading the industry when it came to mobile camera luckily the same continues for this phone as well pretty good image quality from the 5mp cam however it doesnt come with flash the lowlight photography is a bit terrible dont even dream about clicking photos at night but if you are gonna click pics when the world is awake you will be smiling a lot with the pics it clicks another thing missing in this department is no front cam if you are selfie addict fret not you can use the 34selfie34 app from microsoft was known as glam me before the recent launch of 830 to click selfies from rear camera it worked surprisingly well however if you wanted to use the phone for video calls sorry about that you should look at other sets available at this range  display  if you want the technical details as mentioned above 4534 screen resolution of 480x854 218ppi which frankly is pretty sharp is fair enough for most of the usage scenarios except when a page has really small text it sucks in that scene the colours look pretty decent watching videos on it is a decent experience but dont think about dumping 720p movie collection more suitable for watching youtube vids or other online streaming services  battery life  well for my usage wifi and gps always on brightness 70 5 hours of whatsappfboffice mails 2 hours of music an hour and half of gaming 23 hours of speaking on the phone it leaves me with around 40 at the end of the day so as far as im concerned im pretty satisfied one more thing to note is that i keep my location tracking and step counter on too  music  the loud speakers live up to their name they are amply loud havent heard any crackling of any shrill noise in the playback that ive seen in other phones which are this loud or louder music playback on earphones are satisfactory nothing that great nothing that bad either if you are an audiophile even partly keep no expectations from this phone  calling and network  given we are talking about a phone it is obvious that even this point be covered though a dual sim phone it is a single standby set so while you are attending a call on one sim the other one is as good as useless that is the only one but a major issue about the dual sim feature of the phone if you dont expect much calls to come on both the sims at the same time home and office sim not really a problem call quality and reception is flawless nothing to worry about here in this department  all in all this is a great phone and as an ordinary user im very satisfied with it those of you who are hoping to install cracked apps it is a crime refrain from doing so support the developers or custom roms none exist it is a tightly closed environment will be disappointed though but those of you who want a good smartphone which is affordable and at the same time is feature packed this should be your choice however visit some shops and try the phone yourself reading reviews is helpful to only filter down the number of options not the adviced way to make selections go to a retailer try it out yourself see how well you agree with the review you read about it when you compare it to your interaction with it
2186	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	this phone has a serious heating problem and bad battery backup even if you talk for 10 minutes on this phone you can easily feel much heat battery backup is pretty bad even on standby with data off and the phone on standby you can easily loose 10 of the battery every hour  this means the total standby time is 10 hours only
2187	Nokia Lumia 630 (Black, Dual SIM)	windows 81 action center apps to sd are just mediocre features which dont appeal much looks and live tile display are the only relief dont buy if you are an avid music lover because theres no equalizer got in a deal for 8499 1200 lesser than the original price so worth the money for the windows experience

2208	Micromax Canvas 2 Colours A120 (4GB, Grey)	based on usage of a monthbought it for my father its heavy big and make it good for rough use but then it comes with so many rubbish apps that you cant avoid until you root internal space is 25 gb that is like it ends before you install i was hardly able to install less than 10 required apps for him until the space finally gave up if you are thinking that you can transfer all apps to sd then you are wrong i got a 16 gb installed here but only 3 apps could be moved so no matter what you need to root to get all the power out of it which is again not recommended while its on warranty camera is good earphone bad there are other powerful models available for the same price or a little bit higher better go for that this mobile is history now also still feeling bad to buy this could have looked for a better mobile absence of pc suite from micromax is another problem a layman or a new user will face because they would like to take backups regularly  pros 1 screen 2 camera 3 body  cons 1 battery being the biggest  wont even last half a day 2 low space for apps 3 too much of junk apps that you wont use but installed because obviously  sponsors 4 no ui i would rather want a good ui like miui to make it easier to operate this phone doesnt even have anything available like you cant see the flashlight unless you install an app you dont have qr scanner so another app uis these days have all of them available to you android ui is getting older 5 no pc suite by micromax no idea why all the international companies or even the local phone companies gives it  recommend better mobile like yu or the new chinese smartphones much more powerful than this with greater space and less junk apps
2209	Micromax Canvas 2 Colours A120 (4GB, Grey)	i bought this phone about 6 months back and i am varying between saying the phone is ok and i dont like it the ordering and delivery part were very smooth impressive even which has given me confidence in amazons ability to deliver high quality high value items in a safe timely manner well done  now to the phone i bought this hoping the indian made a120 would replace my iphone 5s yet when i opened the box i came to know this handset is made in china bad mark from the outset it does look decent its bigger than the 5s but probably about par with the iphone 6 size in fact this micromax canvas a120 looks remarkably like a spice phone i had earlier the screen is reasonably sharp buttons are fine design is clean if unimaginative  now to the cons yes it has internal sd and i bought the 32gb external sd for it still the phone comes loaded with lots of google and micromax apps i think i have loaded only about 12 additional apps and all that i can i have moved to external sd all the google micromax junk that i dont use which is most of it i have tried to disable uninstall it still shows as having 5gb free on the internal sd and 315gb free on my external sd still i am unable to download anything else onto the micromax since it keeps saying insufficient memory yes i have mad the external sd as default yes i have moved all possible apps to external sd all the things micromax recommends ive done this is my first and biggest detractor to the phone  secondly the screen itself is not always responsive it seems to come and go with its sensitivity to my touch sometimes it takes a single touch as a double entry sometimes it gives feedback but does not actually register the character i touched the instructions have not been clear as to what all the swipes will do either so a lot of what ive learned on this phone as gestures i have learned for my iphone or kindle first then tried on the micromax further even if i switch on auto rotation i dont think it has ever let me do anything in landscape always portrait mode  as for the battery it does last longer than the iphones in my experience that is until i switch on data connection then it seems to leak power  this was my first android phone and i have to say it will be my last not impressed
2210	Micromax Canvas 2 Colours A120 (4GB, Grey)	hey all  first i wanted to thanx mmx for this great phone in this range i have been using this phone since last 8 month and got a very good exp with it 1  greatness about the phone is its processorbelieve me i dont have any memory when i had to switch off my phone due to hung 2  i used to play almost all kind of game in the phone without any lag or hung issue or game not responding s 3  camera wow you will experience a very sensible quality while using camera in day time if you are comparing its 8mp to any 8mp phone which cost inr 30000 then probably you are a dumb but in dark it is just average 4 display is the second best feature in a120 after its processor you can enjoy 1080p with ultra high quality ips display 5  look wise it is very rich and i like this very much it doesnt look like it worth only 9000when i purchased also it is more thin if you didnt use galaxy s4 kind of phone 6  a phone by indian company with better specification dont cry it made in china even iphone also now made in china  as nothing is perfect so here are negative points of phone 1  battery goes sucked up faster in comparison of other phones if you are playing game or surfing the net but if phone is on ideal mode even with data pack on and with full brightness it will stand with u till about one and half days 2  memory is 1gb thats ok but with time you will feel that this is very low as you could use only 500mb while its max memory is full with os only 3  got heat up when you are playing high resolution game and charging at same time for more than 2 hours but thats ok as all phone have same problem  overall i will prefer this instead of spending 30000 on the other phone with this kind of processor and gaming experience specially when you get its fantastic looks in your hand a thumbs up for mmx
2211	Micromax Canvas 2 Colours A120 (4GB, Grey)	this is my first budget android phone used many high end phone but wanted a second backup phone so bought this awesome phone first off this is an honest review i love most of this phone and hate some  so i start with what i lovefirst thing i noticed is the box its fancy and a gr8 budget mobile box and its sturdy anough to protect the mobile while its in transist and right after unboxing what youll get is ear phone 2 swapable punchy coloured back coversi got yellow and blue back covers they enhganced the look of this mobile i prefer the yellow one over blue one and you get ther charger and a usb cable and with manualsright after i got his phone in my hands its felt like a budgetly premium smartphone the build is seriously sturdy solid awesome at this price tag its made of plastic but youll never be reminded of that this phone is made up of plastic and coming to display it the best colours look punchy detailed and vivid and viewing angles are great and 294ppi makes this display sharp youll never a pixel untill you stick your eyes to the display otg is supported and camera is 8mp snapper at rear and 2mp at front and 8mp snapper with led flash gives crisp images and colour reproduction is good but nor gr8 and i love the camera app and performance is gr8 no lags are experienced on ui and ran some heavy games on medium settings they ran fine without hiccups on medium settingsand theres a bit overheating but its bearable its not chip burningly heatedand batter dropped 100 to 70 in 40 mins of asphalt 6 and some video with full brightness and coming to the things which i hate is firstly is its ui its ultra childish and ugly as hell never seen a ui like this really the ui sucksss so i installed the nova launcher and the ui is so awesome now and its lag free so i recommend to install a custom launcherand another thing i hate is theres a gap between display and eargrill it catches lot of dust and should be cleaned everyday with a  sharp peice of paper and ear grill will get loose if u wipe the with cloth screen too hard thats what happened to me and theres a led a light in ear grill which is good but it looks like cheap quality one when its lit up and the battery life suckssss its gives 2 hours of onscreen time on heavy usage with birghtness cranked to 100 so overall this a gr8 smartphone with some compromises i recommend anyone to buy phoneyoull surely love this beast and youll surely hate the battery backup
2212	Micromax Canvas 2 Colours A120 (4GB, Grey)	i recently purchased this phone and i would like to share my user experience regarding specs its all said and known however this new model comes with android kikkat 44 and 8 gb rom which is a good improvement from earlier version of this mobile first of all the display and touch is very good while the camera is very good outdoor the indoor pic is not upto the mark but still at this price we wont get samsung or sony camera the battery life is average like most of the smartphone and with only 2000 mah we dont expect much it also comes with three additional back panel cover now coming to the cons the speaker sound quality is average but good while using a good earphone the earphone given in the box is ordinary having said that the clearity of voice and network availability is good and it is one of the best mobile with low budget and mid range specs so i recommend all to purchase it lastly i would like to thank amazon for their prompt service even flipkart fall short in this matter thanks once again
2213	Micromax Canvas 2 Colours A120 (4GB, Grey)	best surprise was full hd ie 1080 recording of video which was not mentioned in features list that apart looks are good cameraramstorage processor speed worth more than what i paid for drawbacks are its weight480grams pulls on my shirt when i keep it in shirt pocket also crapware cant be uninstalled i could root the phone with instructions from httpandroidxdacomrootmicromaxa120canvas2colors overall excellent buy 
2214	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	this review is a long one i know but i have included almost all details which will help you to decide about purchasing this phoneor any other phone so please read review

upgrade511mb on 19092014  4 no usb otg no compass 03 mp front camera no gorilla glass protection  pls read detailed review completely  1 processor  no lag for phone 4 cores at 13 ghz max each core can work in 5 different states 59874710401196 and 1300 mhz independently so power management is perfect when phone is in idle mode only one core is working598mhz as seen by app resource monitor and at max 4 cores 1300 seen it rarely  2 ram sufficient 1 gb ram is sufficient for all applications in my one month usage i have seen that at least 50 mb ram is left even if we load many applications if we boost phone with boosting software preloaded we get free ram of about 600mbso os just takes about 450mb ram  3 camera 03 mp front camera is a slight drawback but if we take photo in enough lighting its ok 8 mp cmos rear camera is sufficient default camera setting is 6mpto see n  take image in full screen we can change it to 8mp via settings but the images cant be seen in full screen when we shoot special camera modes are hdr we get high clarity pics face beauty panorama multi angle view something like 3d imaging smile detection best shot  live photo modeyou get this after kit kat updateit takes a photo along with a few secs of video touching and holding camera button will give a continuous shot of 40 photos in 68 secs led flash is good it gives good pictures in absolute dark room environment also a preloaded app makes it a torchafter kit kat updateapp no longer needed it can be opened from notification paneltoggle function menu video recording good videos can be seen in laptop with good clarity  also there is continuous auto focussome mentioned that video runs out of focus if phone is moved but there is a delay for one or two secs but still video is ok  4 battery using live wallpaper wifi bluetooth gps unnecessarily will drain battery it is a user replacable 3000 mah lipolymer battery lasts a day for medium use for heavy use  it reached 15 when used as a navigation device ie gps on display on mobile data 2g on for 8 hours for normal use it last 15 days and more just calls and messaging and some browsing charging 1100 approx 200mins via usb 20 it takes half of that via ac charger use usb charging battery temp is just below 30 degs but via ac it reaches upto 35 degs seen by using a battery monitor software playing asphalt 7 playing for 30 mins with full brightness and full volume costs 10 battery asphalt 8 working and takes almost same battery but slight heating of mobile occurs video playback full volume full brightness full hd for 30 mins we loss 10 battery face book via 2g 30 mins costs 5 battery after full charging if we use it for 10 mins or less battery drops to 97  but after that its ok advantage of user replacable battery your phone gets strucknot responding and power button does nothing pull out battery and restart phone  5 display feels like hd 180 degree viewing angle 47 inches qhd ips good display good clarity and brightness use glossy screen guard instead of matte finish type to get perfect display we can see hd movies etc with perfect clarity touch response is very good  a small gap from display is sensed we dont need to touch display if you can really control your hand try it 5 point multi touch is good i called lenovo and they told me that display is made of glass but not gorilla glass i have a few issues with touch sensitivity when i keep phone in my pocket when power button is pressed it instantly locks phone and display is off but display becomes on due to some notifications and phone unlocks automatically and calls are dialled when a notification comes display becomes active since our skin is near the displayhas a capacitive effect even if our shirtfabric is in between just like touching with fingers but here a lot of frequent touches and  these weird actions occur i found that it occurs with all capacitive displays so to avoid it use a phone cover which covers display also or keep some papernotes in between   edit there are apps in playstore to sense whether phone is in pocket or not use itgravity sensor apps8230 the 3 capacitive buttons like back menu  are backlit so its easier to use in dark environment also they are not onscreen so we get full display for viewing a total of 18 home screens can accommodate all app shortcutswidgets so a 20x18  360 appsnormal icons 4 in app dock at bottom can be easily accommodated also if needed drag one app over other to create an additional folder  6 sound and  mic good speaker is good not stereo only one some people complained about very low volume but i didnt feel that speaker is loud and clear if volume is set to high level 15 there is a slight distortion rarely for some frequencies mic there are two microphones one at bottom of phone primaryand one at rearnoise cancellation phone gives clear calls due to the additional noise cancellation mic in rear of phone about included headset low quality head set but its ok in a quiet environment no ear cushions also they are not noise cancellation type and also not in ear  7 storage 8 gb internal memory  only approx 57 gb available to user  upto 32 gb microsd card support i use class 1016gb microsdedit now upgraded to strontium 32gb class 10uhs 1  no app to sd so we have to be careful about number of apps we install  also no usb otg so no attaching of a pen drive edit after kitkat update app to sd is enabled how to enable app to sd go to settingsstorage set default write disk to sd card it will tell you to restart phone after restarting apps can be moved by going to settingsappsopen each app and move we cannot move all appssome app data to sd cardsome system apps  8 design slim metallic design  premium look with titanium color  brushed aluminium back panel good for one hand operation  no fingerprints n smudges there are 5 connections like gold plated coming to the back panel it might be for antenna or heat transfer dont know battery is just under that so if we hold phone in hand temperature of body is easily absorbed by back panel and reaches battery so using protective case is good free magic case dont keep phone over a hot surface or inside a hot car it will reduce battery lifenot battery runtime simply your battery will be useless fast and you have to buy a new one  9 free magic coversnap stand acts as a standverticalhorizontal and also protects phone as a bumper case thanks to lenovo for that all my friends liked it  10 sensors proximity sensor good response for the sensor but when we move phone from ear the display is not suddenly active it has a weird delaythis issue is less after firmware upgrades accelerometer sensitivity is good proximity sensor becomes off if we attach headphone notification light red for charging blinking blue for missed calls blinking red for mail blinking green for sms goto settingsdisplayled notification light sensor at front near proximity sensor good it controls display brightness if auto brightness is set so display changes brightness but occurs also during playback gamingsometimes not so attractiveflexible no compass but while navigating display automatically adjusts to route  11 preloaded apps lenovo secureit an allinone app for antivirus privacy speed up data usage control  antitheft private space for calls n sms  call blocker and parental controls what i really liked is the firewall in data usage section we can set which apps are permitted to access internet so i can save a lot of data also speed up via clean up widget update secureit to latest version is perfect more ram is freed compared to any other clean up utility  edit lenovo secureit is now security and it8217s a trial version i had a subscription but i lost it when i did a reset of my phone so i contacted lenovo team and they replied that it8217s a trial version and we can8217t uninstallrequires rooting which voids warranty but disable it in app options when trial version ends we can use it but we can8217t update antivirus all other functions works perfectly  mobile assistant in phone and pc just like a pc suite all functions uninstall back up also we can view what is on mobile display but with a 3 second delay usb20 note when we connect s660 to a pc usb computer connection pops up there is an option for cdrom which gives some cool apps for pc copy it and keep it safe after kk update this  nolonger avaliable edit after kitkat update installing mobile assistant in pc enabling usb debugging will install mobile assistant app in phone so backup your cd rom contents  video player it is ok but does not play all files like mkv so i used kmplayer for hd playbackor mx player edit video player app icon not avaliable after kk update but when we try to open a video there is option to select video player  navigation route66 maps very good download map pack for india 123 gb and set install location to sd card which saves phone memory agps can set profile google or nokia also epo extended prediction orbit of mediatek an offline server based  agps download it is useful you lose this after kk update  tethering wifi  hot spot all modes of tethering supportedbluetooth usb has option usb internet we can use internet from  our pc to our mobile reverse tethering  the softwares used for monitoring are resource monitor it shows a floating bar which shows current ram core speeds n numbers etc and battery for battery my experiences i selected this phone with help of some websites smartprix for selecting best phone in this range buyhatke to select best price from different sellers thanks to amazon for hosting this market place and delivery to my place no other e commerce website delivers here  also phone was delivered by fedex in 4 days mumbai to calicut in two days 2day a slight delay by fedex as my place is a little remote  sellertechkitchendeals was nice they replied to all my queries promptly before and after purchase  also warranty is valid i contacted seller after purchase and they guaranteed about warranty also i checked lenovo site my phone warranty is valid for 1 year from date of purchase 14 june 2014 you must get a vat bill with seller tin number and one primary imie of phone  at the time of my purchase this phone was best budget phone inr 11150from a good company indian manufacturers also provide phones at this or higher specs but i feel lenovo is better than them lenovo has a reputed brand name history in computer manufacturing  now asus zenphone has come but s660 still has a user replaceable battery quad core metallic body more battery and also fm radio so still a value for money  edit slight heating occurs while playing graphic intensive games but when games is closed temperature goes back to normal  on 19 sep 2014 kitkat 442 update was released check for software updates in phone settings about phonesystem updates now the entire look and feel of interface is changed thanks to lenovo team the settings menu icons are now better also now a lot of options are available in developer options menu  performance increased  edit 19 oct  after kit kat update 1 warning we cant install additional files to memory card so asphalt 7 or 8additional files must be downloaded and installed in phone memoryconsuming 740 mb and route66 maps for india also123gb but setting default write disk to sd card will change this and all data is stored in sd card and also gives you app to sd  2 by using developer option we can use dalvikart runtimes change animation  increase graphic performance  enable developer option by  settingsabout phoneversion infos and tap  build number 7 times or more then come back to settings  developer options is just above 8220about phone8221 changing to artinstead of dalvikdefault will increase performancesome say so phone will restart saying andriod is upgrading but some apps might fail to run in the new runtime  3 in settingsstorage there is an option to set default write disk to phone memory or sd card in previous versions this can be easily changed to one another but after kk update if we change phone memorydefault to sd card phone must be restarted and also app to sd becomes active but when we change deffault write disk to phone storage again all programs must be changed to phone memory else it won8217t work 4 gps option is removed instead location option came with 3 modes device only gps battery saving wlan mobile networks and high accuracy gpswlanmobile network  5 in user interface long pressing any app iconor empty screen will give you options to    1 uninstallclick x mark over icon   2addremove widgets   3 batch move app iconsclicking app icon once will send it to taskbar click from taskbar will send it to window   if you want to take a screenshot just press volume lowpower button together screenshot is saved  touch and go vertical down anywhere on screennotification panel drops down go vertical updesktop settings pops up  use 2 fingers and pull down notification baryou get function toggle bar  use two fingers and touch vertically down on screen apps will get organised at bottom and vice versa  the back panel is metal if a sand particle gets struck between magic case and back plate  you get a shiny scratch so when you apply a new screen guard take the screen guard plastic cover that is already on  phone display and stick it to back

 pls give a thumbs up yes button below if you like my review i would really like to know who all  likedpurchased  this  phonereview  fb rakesh thettath mail to rakeshthettathgmailcom
2215	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	i purchased this mobile for the battery backup onlyafter using a week and couple of charge and discharge process i got the perfect battery backupi am really happy with the battery back and  processing speed
2216	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	applause for amazon and fed ex service i have ordered on the late night of 1st june and receive it on 4th june  regarding the phone i was frustrated with the performance of samsung and similar looking models hence i decided to opt for a different make and lenovo provided me just that pros and cons listed below based on my 7days observation  pros  1 primary camera8mp provides really good picture quality 2 performance is really smooth without any lack smooth touch and quick response 3 battery back up is up to the mark considering 3hrs of talktime and net surfing on 2g battery easily stretches for 48 hrs 4 experience of no heating of charging mobile 5 47 inches screen size in this cost is really good 6 free magic cover is really catchy and sustainable  cons 1 no centralized menu option present need to store all the apps shortcut  you have to store all of them in desktop with folder structure 2 similar phone moto g is updated with android 44 kitkat but no updates is available for this phone yet 3 dialing a number takes a lot of steps even when its on contact list  in spite of cons i will suggest to buy this phone
2217	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	this is a good buy in this price rangei got the phone after fourth day of the orderabsolutely wonderful delivery from amazonupdated the phone to android 44 kitkatgreat speed good design and also good sound clarity dont go for samsung or nokia you should opt for these types of companiessince lenovo is no1 in laptops and accessories i  am sure they will also become no1 in smartphones 
2218	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	i bought a lenovo s660 from amazon on 9 aug and go it delivered on 13th good service from amazon guys  started using and was extremely happy with most of its features the battery lasted for 2 days day 1 8 am to day 2 10 pm with full usage since i was syncing all data and accounts and testing all features also there was a phone update available 100mb so i installed the update however once i synced all accounts and data it started a weird behavior it restarted abruptly while operating this happened a couple of times first the next day it was worse it could happen any time while taking calls dialing numbers checking mail operating any app or even just unlocking the phone immediately reported to both amazon customer care and lenovo customer care it seemed that there might a software issue since i installed an update which might not have installed properly so the next day i went to lenovo service center indiranagar bangalore the guy updated the software tried it for the weekend but to no use the same problem cropped up again finally i returned the phone to amazon with full refund  key takeaways  1 dont update the software although that was not the problem with me but the lenovo guys are themselves not confident about it there were at least 2 more customers when i went who had a software issue 2 be prompt when you see a problem you can get your money back kudos to amazon for being supportive and making the process hassle free though it takes some time to get it back 
2219	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	phone is very smooth and fast in loading applications display resolution is very good music on headphones is good but that on speakers has scope for improvement rear camera is goodbut front cam is vga only battery performance is average only though 3000mah when data is connected on one simincoming calls to the other sim becomes not reachable most times however the overall performance of the phone is good and it is value for money
2220	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	the phone is solid and provides a quality feel it will certainly not loose its finish with time as is true with other branded phones i had presented it to my spouse and she is loving it as rightly pointed out by other members the user interface of the phone is real bad but that can be easily improved by loading the free android launcher application suiting your taste the camera is not that bad as pointed out by some members unless you have huge expectations the audio quality is decent and  call quality is also good stock android games like temple run without any stutter kitkat was supposed to get officially updated but it is surprising that no update is still available i would give it a buy recommendation who is looking to retain the phone for at least a couple of years and yet have something looking new if you are looking for something flashy dont go for it the phone is decent  and looks elegant to carry
2221	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	review after 7days usage wo kitkat update i brought it for rs8100 with 10 cash back  what is good  the performance is good i did not notice any lagging even while playing 34asphalt 734 race game  in phone stand by mode screen off battery can last atleast two weeks i enabled only 2g nw  sim card slots are of regular size  average  less customization of screen settings individual volume controls not possible to change led notifications colors  interface is average setting options are not too high just average which are fine for may users  signal reception is not great may be it is because of low sar value  not so thin but no thick also  i heard no stable kitkat update they are about to release one more patch for kitkat so i did not plan to upgrade it now  bad  when screen is awakeon then battery drains fast no wifidata connection enabled if 34auto brightness34 option is not enabled i belive within 10hrs battery will be empty for sure  front camera is vga03mp i compromised here while buying  tough to open the back panel and to insertremove the sd card or sim cards battery needs to be removed though those slots are beside the battery  there is no magnetic sensorsame is present in my 35 yrs oldgalaxy pro phone that means we can not use compass applications to know the poles and even gps navigation also may not be more accurate  came to know that customer service is bad  as i got this mobile for 8k approx i am ok to use it further however if you have to spend more than 10k better to cross check  note there is no need of buying this phone because of more battery capacity
2222	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	for all those who dont know about lenovo its simple they used to make parts for ibm thinkpads and in 2005 lenovo bought ibm and now they are the world s biggest computer provider for offices mainly now they are also getting on the high street market and making laptopstablets and mobile phoneslenovo is a great budget phone please buy original lenovo models only some of models like a766 is not official model from the original lenovo manufacturer but it available at the market the easiest way to know certain models are ofdicial models feom lenovo is you can search a model in lenovo website or gsmarena websitethe battery is pretty good  3000mah why is the talktime only 10 hours  is that spec released by lenovo or calculated by gsmarena
2223	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	i am very satisfied with lenovo s660 mobile  its working very nice i suggest this mobile its really nice one
2224	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	poor delivery service of courier had to track it but using the phone it was worth it the only negative ill give to it is a front vga camera  no menu button i was in a dillema to go for xperia c or motog few colleagues at workplace were already into motog admiration my roomie uses xperiac  i was darted on to it incredible battery life 93  consumed in 72 hrs loving the lenovo premium apps screen clarity is neck to neck with xperia c touch is just gliding some people have already started envying it whereas others are going to buy it great value for money even keboard typing this is more effort taking than typing on my lenovo  i would recommend it to all
2225	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	hi i am using this phone last 2 months i purchase it online from a other shopping site it is a very smart phone in 10 to 12k price range better function 5gb storage 1 gb ram latest android version  8 mp camera with hdr photoshoot and hd recording  i am also playing games in it without any disturbance really its giving me a excellent experience after using i love its ui and ux battery backup is also very good with 2g network its battery working whole day
2226	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	this phone is a bit of step down from the samsung model i used earlier here are some of the pros and cons  pros 1 superb battery life hadnt charged it for two days and used minimally yet i still had 76 battery life 2 strong sturdy build 3 loud speaker 4comes with screen guard and back case  cons 1 back cover is difficult to open you need to use your fingernails to prise it open alternatively use a pen or screwdriver first 2 uses a mini sim something not mentioned in the description 3 user interface does not support removal of app icons from desktop youll need to create a separate window on your desktop which you will rarely use and push all unwanted icons there makes the desktop cluttered 4 speaker quality could be better music plays with a small amount of distortion but disappears when listening via earphones 5 there are no proper user manuals for operating it they do not come with the phone nor are they available on the lenovo support website i had to call up customer support several times for help 6 poor camera quality front and back
2227	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	well this is my first smartphone so i really have no standard of reference to compare it to nevertheless i think there are some basic pros and cons that i have figured about this phone over the last 2 months and here they are  positives 1 the battery is good 3000mah is great to have a single full charge can last two days but of course that depends on how you use it and for what 2 sar levels are very low compared to some other brands if you are concerned about roasting your brain which i am 3 looks absolutely stylish  negatives 1 the loudspeaker is rubbish even at about 60 you have to be selective about the ringtones you use something with a little bass in it and the speaker starts sputtering and crackling very irritating and not becoming of a phone of this quality 2 the automatic brightness control is haywire and is basically of little use you will have to either leave it at a high level and let it be or keep changing it manually depending on the ambient light level which can be a bit dicey if you suddenly go into sunlight and have to make your screen brighter and you realize you cant see whats on your screen to make the change 3 i thought the dialer was very drab and boring but that can be remedied with truecaller truedialer or any other similar app so it isnt that big an issue  overall i love this phone and i think for the price83k and the quality offered not to mention the lenovo brand name it is a great buy
2228	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	bought this product after a lot of research and zeroed down to this criteria for selection 1 good screen resolution  i already own a couple of nexus phones so kind of used to it 2 at least 1 gb of ram  needed to make it process stuff smoothly 3 battery bigger the better  the lenovo s660 comes right of the block with great build and specs fulfilling all my above criterion here is the experience of unboxing and usage after 2 weeks the phone is well packaged and comes with a free case which has a brilliant flexi back which when flipped makes the phone rest in portrait and landscape mode for easy use all accessories like charger headphones come with it the display although mentioned as ips doesnt feel so but has a robust build quality and the titanium metal cover at the back feels good in your hands the rear camera is decent and do not expect any miracles the megapixel race doesnt translate into clear pictures processing is super fast and absolutely no lag in the user experience the ui is good but however resorted to the google launcher app drawer is missing a security app always runs in the background and am surprised with its optimized usage of ram brilliantly done lenovo on that wifi connectivity is good however the mobile signals are a tad to weak but doesnt result in any call drops or quality and the biggest surprise of all is the monster of a battery with 3g data on and almost 6hrs of talk time in two days and surfing for an hour and playing videos for an hour the batter still shows me 20 left i simply love this phone for this looks all the other sins have been redeemed as a smartphone user for years this performance has beaten all expectation at this price bracket
2229	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	pros   1 the side standit actually use tostand you phone horizontallyfor moviesand othersit also used as a cover for our awesome phone  2 back panelit is so strongand looks premiumits actually plasticbut it is so hardand premiumthat it looksmetal body  3 screen size4734 mind blowingsizeperfect size for everyonei have used previously 534 phonesbut sometimes it is difficult for me to use my phone with one hand  4 screen clarity if you thinkthat low qhd is badcheck the device then say anythingqhd is actually sufficient for average users  6 ram 810 mb free after 2 hours heavy usage lenovo skin is very light  7 speakers are amazing bose like quality   8 camera 8mp back camerais good saturation and colors are good 1080 p videos is an added advantage 9 battery lasts around 2 days on casual ussage and 1 day on heavy usage 10 no heating problemthe phone is amazing form outside as well as insidetoo the highest temperature that i encountered was 38 degreeswhile chargingotherwiseits a cool phone  cons   1 earphone quality is quite good but the bundeled earphones are horrible  2 front camera vga horrible quality  the custom ui is actually goodbut you can usevarious other launchersfrom play store  good phone but you may consider lenovo a6000 as its cheaper and even has 4g
2230	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	screen size  810 47 inch screen is great to handle and big enough for movies and entertainmentalthough 5 inch is even better viewing angle  75  10 resolution  75  10 battery  20  10 better than what i expectedmakes me remember my nokia days easily lasts 23 days on full charge and above mid usage on normal usage  can easily last to 34 days call quality  75  10 performance  9  10no lag at even heavy games like asphalt airborne and fifa 2014 magic cover  85 10 good quality and great to watch media content and the best thing its freeee build quality  85  10 metal back cover is very strong and looks premium avoid heating  85  10 does not heats too much at mid usagemaybe the metal back cover helps to dissipate heat charging  15  10 charges upto 80 in about 45 minthats actually a feature of lenovo charger  havent tried with other chargers or usb charging time  if i keep it at a charge of 50 in the night at around 10 pm then in the morning at 9 am the phone only discharges to 49 or 48  in 2g network and no usage apart from a alarm
2231	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	phone with brilliant features at affordable price have used it around a month heres my review 1 battery very nice  last more than 2 days on quite heavy usage continuously on wifi and lots of browsing dont play much games 2 camera pic quality good in daylight not great or ok in night less exposure to light secondary cam not good but doesnt matter to me 3 lenovo ui very cluttered but dont worry install good launchers from google play like go  apus launcher then ur phone gets complete new look so this small problem can easily be done away with 3 good inbuilt storage of 6gb available to user  expabdable storage ofcourse is there 4 practically no cons fast processor quad core perfect size for one hand operation good looks  noise cancellation feature present 5 upgradable to kitkat  conclusion  no doubt great buy u will b happy to own it also brought this phone for my elder brother very impressed with rhe phone
2232	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	just to hold it this phone feels right i have mixed feeling about this  good stuffs got better deal in amazon and they have next day delivery option so amazingly doesnt feel cheap at this price range and you even get a free magic case as they have named it   out of 8gb you get 5gb internal memory plus you can extend it no problem  no lags what so ever  good reception on dual sim  screen is bright enough  battery last for a day on medium to heavy usages  lenovo custom user interface which doesnt have the usual androids app drawer which in my opinion is far better and enough for efficient use  lenovo has included three very useful apps share it sync it and security  security app bundled with antivirus data management system booster system privacy settings which allows to you to block unnecessary access to your system info by apps pretty handy i say and sim data calibration other two apps didnt find any use  and as promised recently been updated to kitkat  now the things that is annoying  why do they have to be half witted in making the user interface fine they have tweaked here and there which makes it look good but at the same time they have left some portion pretty much stock half hearted effort which by the time you will update to kitkat will find they have made no effort perhaps they less bothered of mid end devices  this phone is haunted believe me it wakes up with no reason you keep it in your pocket and next you find it woke up and somehow managed to open whole bunch to apps although with kitkat update it has been contained  toggling between 2g to 3g is pain each time have to dig in deep for settings  camera dont leave the settings to auto it makes photo soft and fuzzy try manually  enough said all in all superb phone at just 10k
2233	Lenovo S660 (Gold)	i bought this product twice both of them were faulty the common problem was the faulty bottom bottons that fail to register the touches and had to touch many times to get the touch registered there were other problems such as the notification led used to stay still instead of blinking in one of them lenovo suddenly removed the kitkat update so had to use the old jellybean the build quality isnt good and looks very fragile also doesnt look durable at all very cheap product from lenovo i returned the product once to amazon and once to flipkart thanks to both amazon and flipkart for sending money back to my bank account it was cash on delivery amazon returned money with no questions asked i had to answer many questions over phone from flipkart before they finally accepted my return request in the end i bought lg l90 by adding a few thousand rupees and it was worth it
2234	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	its a good phone especially according to its price it has much more features than should be available only the in call volume is a bit low but it is manageable or else it is superb the white back cover gives it a better look
2235	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	sucks big time cant use sd card and in built memory is only 4gb which isnt enough i regret buying this phone if only i had know how much it sucks
2236	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	another over priced phone with inferior specs a phone that costs almost 10k has no hd screen  what a joke xiaomi redmi 1s costs 6k  offers hd screen lenovo a6000 which costs 7k not only has hd display but also offers 4g rest of the specs are generic so i wont get into the details of those asus zenfone 5 offers 2gb of ram for 8k  if anyone has extra money to squander please donate to charity than buying this  so i urge anyone looking for a phone below 10k to consider other better options and never ever think to buy this garbageaka desire 616
2237	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	good product of htc only problem is its battery life volume is also comparatively low camera functions are good enough nice item diligent choice if you are going for thanks amazon
2238	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	this phone is a piece of junk dont even think of buying it it is powered by an inferior snapdragon 200 quad core soc which isnt even close to the new chinese mediatek cpus youd be better off buying the lenovo a6000 or a xiaomi even xolo has some marvellous phones under its hood the 4 gb memory is rubbish when you are paying almost 10k guys please dont go by some of the positive reviews as ppl writing them are absolutely technically challenged
2239	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	phone quality is best but there are some things that should be improved 1 weight should be decreased 2 camera quality is poor
2240	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	the main problem is the back keys are not working and camera clearity is not so good night camera is worst not hearing sound in bus not upgradeable to v44  os mobile weight is more no battery backup
2241	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	except camera other features are good camera is too sensitive to its position how you hold it while taking the shotdepending on its tilt the objects in the photos look shorter or longer than the original size similarly even a slight movement of the object while taking the shot blurs the photo i had earlier used the samsung galxy fit before this htc phone and never had any such problems with its camera
2242	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	if ur planning to buy a smart phone you can go for any other model not this    i am feeling bad after buying this phone  htc desire 516 has only one problem which is a major problemyou cant move apps from phone storage to sd card how are we going to install mutiple appswhen you have only 1gb of storage its not an user friendly phone camera is ok but  sound quality is bad
2243	HTC Desire 516 (Dual SIM, Pearl White)	every accessories works properly good interface processor works good you can try it
2244	Meizu m1 note (White)	i will not recommend this mobile worst mobile everthank god mobile didnt blasted in my pockets while using it be careful
2245	Meizu m1 note (White)	this phone volume is very less nearly not audible
2246	Meizu m1 note (White)	i order this phone on june 5 and received it on 7 june by two day guarantee delivery i was bit worried after looking at some reviews down here regarding heating and all but when i started using it i loved it the screen is awesome accurate colour reproduction with great viewing angles i felt the display quality is much better than some of high end devices camera quality is really good for close up shot as compare to normal shots the flyme os is good experience is more simplistic but i felt meizu need to work on their on screen back button as it dont support some of the apps when you open image file in it back button problem is only in play store and keep safe the speaker is not loud but when you put headphones it gives great audio experience
2247	Meizu m1 note (White)	first of all amazon delivery service like always is just amazing ordered it on the day of sale and got it delivered on friday  now coming to the phone the design looks nice but has a glossy back it is prone to slipping and fingerprints there is only 1 button on the front size instead of the standard 3 buttons system of android this definitely takes up a good amount of time to get used to but there is a youtube video explaning the meizu os features and tips and tricks of using the phone brilliantly with that button check that out as it really helps now due to merging all 3 buttons into one there are few glitches which you can see around in the os like once i took a picture and after i viewed the image the back button never appreared on the screen i had to completely kill the camera app and reopen it as i was not able to click another picture but next time when i clicked it the back button appeared normally so like i said its glitchy  coming to the camera the back is good not great i clicked the same image using oneplus one asus zenphone and nexus the colors of the image clicked from meizu came out a little dull you however get a lot of inbuilt filters which you can use to enhance or completely change the look and feel of the image dont know if i had to use some different settings while using the camera but i clicked it in auto mode and with default factory settings front camera is amazing though perfect for selfies if you are into those kind of pictures  the screen is great amazong clarity and with nice details colors it is 55 inch but it doesnt feel so big in hand because they have used around 72 of the front side only for the screen  the phone comes only in 16gb with no expandable memory you get around 115 gb of space free i keep a lot of songs and games on my phone so this much space is insufficient for me only because of this reason i had to return the phone back to amazon because they had mentioned previously that the phone has expandable memory where second sim card slot can be used as memory card reader but it cannot  amazon handled the return policy very smoothly and i got my complete amount refunded on the same day they collected the phone back from me
2248	Meizu m1 note (White)	advantages fast fluid and clean interface manual camera controls bright and vivid display solid build quality  main disadvantages no microsd card slot no lollipop at launch but very likely coming soon nonremovable battery lackluster speaker design is far from unique software is uninspired and lacks customization
2249	Meizu m1 note (White)	using it from 2 days i can say it is a good  phone for its price  one star is missing because of heating issue and wrong information about extended memory on amazon page  delivery was super fast just in 1 day without choosing one day delivery option  it does not support sd cardas mentioned on page and customer care i am a photographer i wanted a phone under 12k with 55in 1080p display for showing off my photos which only this phone offered no other phone in 12k range offered 55in 1080p for this price  pros 1 55in 1080p display igzo capacitive touchscreen403 ppi sunlight readability is very good and very crisp  it is joy to use this touch screen  2 4g  3g  2g work smoothly with airtel simcard  3 gaming  no lags at all in any intensive game but there is con which i will mention in cons  4 0 bugs  atleast for me not even slowed down for once  5 instant rooting and unrooting  it is very easy to root and unroot this phone as it is included in the os itself  it is an inbuilt fetcher  just log into flyme account and tap on open system privileges and the phone will be rooted and if you log out you phone will be unrooted it is as simple as that  6 design it is a very good design  most of my friends who saw it from front almost thought it was a iphone 6   7 weight  it is very light in handling   cons  1 no extendable memorybut supports otg  2 gaming heating issue  while playing the upper part of the phone heats up under 15 mins but it is very lite heating  but if you play for more than  30 mins it heats up even more  the phone even heats up for games as simple as clash of clans  but it does not drain the battery  life   3  the loudspeaker quality is ok  and not loud enough  can be boosted using apps   4  the headphone jack gain output is very low on all headphones   5 os  interface  ppl who have used i phone will be very familiar to this os  it takes some time to get use to this  but the google now launcher works very fluently on this so no worries and even the smart button can turned off for a back button  6 os  android os v444 kitkat   but update to 51 has been promised by next month  7 camera quality  ok  not that good  sony 5mp camera is better than this 13mp camera  selfi cam is also ok   final verdict  it is a bank for your every buck you have spent on it  it is very snappy and fast phone  with wonderful display which never hangs or lags with intense multitasking  the only major issue is heating while gaming 
2250	Meizu m1 note (White)	with microsd expansion band 40 lte support fm radio and rs2000 lesser price k3 note seems like a better buy only advantages are the corning gorilla glass and usb otg support anyone getting hisher hands on both the devices please comment
2251	Meizu m1 note (White)	very very first and absolutely no lag the mediatech soc is way faster than the qualcomm 615 camera is also extremely good for good lighting conditions but performance degrades at low lighting conditions front camera is extremely good i have also tried asphalt 8 and there were no lag till now there is no lollipop update is available for this phone there are no hard buttons for meenu and back button and which takes sometimes to get used to with it overall at this price i think this phone is better than mi4i i give 5 star for the extremely efficient amazon delivery
2252	Meizu m1 note (White)	i was very eager to buy this from the moment it has been launched but after i bought this device there were few major issues such as there is no support for sd card slot as previously mentioned by the cloudtail then sound quality is awful courtesy very low speaker volumeeven when i contacted meizu customer support to enquire for accessories they replied they are not selling any accessories except the smartphonesee the below photobut rest of the features such as screen resolution is awesome and camera is of average quality but never the less battery life is pretty good

2254	Meizu m1 note (White)	this phone is very much on line of expectations and even exceeds on some features some are  does not become hot was deciding factor while comparing with mi 4i excellent camera fast speed have not hanged till now approx 15 month of usage inbuild junk scanning facility exceedingly good battery life with wifi  3g on sometimes even 3 days i am not in games  let down are speaker volume no android 5 update yet very few stock ringtones and wallpapers  regards
2255	Meizu m1 note (White)	like the phone for its sleekness and looks but there is a slight heating problem flyme updates are not available as needed most of them are in chinese
2256	Meizu m1 note (White)	after using 1months is battery sucks only 2hrs long after full charge and also no external memory card support and no helpline from meizu
2257	Meizu m1 note (White)	phone is good no heating issue in my phone battery backup is really amazing when compare to xiaomi pros 1 screen quality is very good and screen is 55 big one 2battery backup is too goodno negative side as some say 3in this price range this is the best yet quality of phone is good cons only negative side is memory not expandable no external memory
2258	Meizu m1 note (White)	i had purchased this mobile on 17th june this pice looking slim and look like i phone but this phone sound not audible it has very less sound and charging getting down very fast while i am using net it is heating and if we playing games automaticaly getting heat cam 13mp but its acts as 2mpas cam 12000 cost not suitable  some times get struck this worse phone cost is very high
2259	Meizu m1 note (White)	the phone is nice specs were good and price is competitive but the reason i am giving two stars are mentioned below  1 phone supports only 4g and not 4g lte  airtel bangalore customer service confirmed by checking the imei no of the device that it will not support 4g i tested it using a new airtel 4g sim but unfortunately it will not support so in india you cant use 4g on this phone  2 speakers volume is too less you can hardly hear the ringtone even if you set a loud ringtone  3  flyme os is not so user friendlyyou have to get used to it if you are coming from stock android background  4  no sd card slot  only good thing about the phone is the camera and the full hd touchscreen  i have returned the product after using it for 2 days  i will wait for meizu m2 note lets see how it performs  genuine suggestion go for other brands dont buy this product
2260	Meizu m1 note (White)	1st of all like to tell you im proud owner of this machine since 1st sale date 1 if you want big screen without comprising on battery life go for this 2 if you want no lag no hang go for this 3 if you like i phone but cant afford that go for this 4 if you want premium touch screen with outstanding os go for this 5 if you love to click selfie  go for this 6 if you like premium build quality go for this 7 if you like less heating even after 4 hrs continuously gaming go for this  1 if you like expanded memory it doesnt have that option so as i phone dont have that d 2 if you like to hear loud music from phone it doesnt have that impressive speakeri dont want high volume speakers make me feel some cheap phone 3 if you want radio it dont have that option  i hear online by gaana or savan app

2262	Meizu m1 note (White)	great phone unmatched performance and display both front and rear cameras are nice even in the low light battery backup is also good lasts for 15 to 2 days looks like a higher range phone some people are complaining about the operating system but trust me flyme is way quicker than the traditional android once you get used to it
2263	Meizu m1 note (White)	its a good phone works well there are certain apps which pop up in chinese with no translation and says english coming soon meizu should do something about it there is no provision for a nemory card which is a drag the newer phones by lenovo which have a provision for the sane and are slightly cheaper will give it competition

2286	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Black)	nokia 532 comes equipped with a qualcomm snapdargon 200 12ghz quad core msm8212 proccessor with an adreno 302 gpu this is just okay for the price of 6k7k yes its definitely a good initiative from microsoft to provide an alternative lumia for the budget seekers but i think this phone is dated plus why should someone go for lumia 532 when you can get lumia 630 with a snapdragon 400 cpu and a clear black 45 inch ips screen for 6kyeah its true that lumia 532 comes with 1gb ram but it simply doesnt have the cpu nor the gpu to fully capitalize on since this is a windows phone the 512 mb of ram would be more than enough for all day to day usage and only while gaming on high graphics the defieciency of ram maybe felteven you can go lumia 638 with all the internals of lumia 630 plus the 1gb of ram is available at 7k ie the same price of 532 since not only the performance even the screen quality of 638 is much better than this people looking for a good phone at this price irrespective of the os ie windows or android go for android one for 55k or you can even wait for the redmi 2 thats expected to come in a few months for 6k microsoft introduces this phone at a time when budget users are spoilt for choices with so many alternatives at their disposal had they done it a year before then it might have attracted buyers but not now plus their pricing policy is also strange they are even competing with themselves by making lumia 630638 sell for a similar price only pro of this phone is that it is a dual sim variant while the 638 is not but you can get a dual sim variant of 630 and only for this feature i am providing 3 star otherwise it would have been two if you liked my review kindly press the like button below and support me to write more reviews like this in future
2287	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Black)	this phone is not bad at all i think this phone is better than moto e 2nd generation but moto e will cost you 7k all most all features are same except the battery capacity performance of this phon
2288	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Black)	ordered this phone on 17th june and amazon delivered it on 19th i am using this phone right now and in one line i will say that its worth buying let me address the pros and cons of the same pros 12 ghz quad core processor it is definitely one of the fastest phones in this price range 1 gb of ramwindows os lets you run heavy apps orand multiple apps at the same time speakers are pretty loud and clear battery lasts for about a day with moderate usage touch response is good although the hardware navigation keys need to be pressed hard sometimes but i think this is its feature expect a windows 10 update any time now cons no flash light the fixedfocus front camera is below avg phone feels chunky and the edges are sharp and hence not comfortable to hold no usb tethering basic tasks like sending files changing ringtones and installing local apps etc are so complicated that youd think twice before performing them again phone restarts automatically if i shut it down and plug a charger to it  but last not least it comes with several offers like  airtel 500 mb 3g data for 2 months paytm 750 rs cashback offer redbus 1500 rs discount truecaller 6 month pro subscription
2289	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Black)	bought this phone a couple of days ago let me address the pros and cons of the same pros 12 ghz quad core processor it is definitely one of the fastest phones in this price range 1 gb of ramwindows os lets you run heavy apps orand multiple apps at the same time speakers are pretty loud battery lasts for about a day with moderate usage touch response is good although the hardware navigation keys need to be pressed hard sometimes expect a windows 10 update any time now cons no backlight the fixedfocus noflash primary camera is not good at all front camera is a disaster phone feels chunky and the edges are sharp and hence not comfortable to hold no usb tethering the great windows os doesnt allow us to download files larger than 50 mb with cellular data dear microsoft not all lumia users have wifi in their housesofficesnearby places to download large files so if youre reading this please consider allowing download of large files and updates over cellular data small changes like these might bring some life to your everdwindling user base basic tasks like sending files changing ringtones and installing local apps etc are so complicated that youd think twice before performing them again phone restarts automatically if i shut it down and plug a charger to it

2291	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Black)	bought this phone as a short term fix for my moto g which is bricked let me be honest i liked android and thought will never go out of it windows changed my mind such a cool and simple interface its fast damn fast compared to any android device having 2 gigs of memory loved the simplicity of the windows phone os however app market is low i hope it will grow in future coming to build it could have been improved camera is not upto the mark waiting for windows 10
2292	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Black)	i got this product in correct time  the phone finishing is quiet good and front and back camera both looks too ordinaryremoving of back panel was very difficult with given information on manual and i searched in youtube for some video for opening this panel the charger of this phone is too thin and i dont thing it will last long and headset also is like old nokia headset it could have been better

2298	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Black)	this is the second lumia phone i purchased from amazoninitially i purchased nokia lumia 630 but that does not have a front camera this one has a front cameragood price too

2302	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Black)	i brought this mobile but it is of bad quality it shows defects as shown in this image  the display is defective so the red line is  seen
2303	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Black)	i was satisfied to lumia phone
2304	Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (White Frost)	im a developer and i have been using s4 since 1 and half years ill clear all your doubts regarding this phone ihv used black mist and white and last week ihv bought one deep black for my brother using this phone for a week till my brother comes from out of town 1people say that mrp is less 23500 and amazon cheating mrp is lowered here coz they want to save import duty just imagine already samsung is selling the phone at cut throat price and they want some profit also so less mrp low import duty and profit business model 2phone has no warranty seriously this was the most stupid question i heard in the reviews when clearly written 1 year manufacturer warranty and above all amazon and flipkart dont sell products without genuine manufacturer warranty thats why i prefer only amazon or flipkartcourier service and customer support of flipkart is better 3phone is made in vietnam samsungs largest factory is in vietnam and again 3 billion dollars samsung has invested in november 2014 in vietnam for new factory also vietnam govt has given samsung no corporate tax for 4 years and for next 9 years half of corporate tax so obviously theyll make there phones according to samsung making phones in vietnam is 4 times cheaper than making in china and 6 times making in indiaso less labor less tax thats why made in vietnam and phone is cheaper for us 4why flipkart and other sites selling it costly why i should buy from amazon cheaper means cheaper quality or duplicate flipkart and other sites have the old stock which was made in india and with mrp of 33500 obviously they cant lower than 22k to earn profit also theres a contract between samsung and amazon and flipkart for products like galaxy s 3 neo for 125 k only on flipkart and 17999 s4 only on amazon you check price of s3 neo on amazon its 24k so that doesnt means its fake and all its market strategy to live and let live others every one gets there share 5 why samsung has lowered the price its worst brand first of all the product is too old its 2 years old and in technology world 2 year means millions of years those who have bought phone for 42k already have switched to s5 or some other high ends the price lower is a good sign for middle class public in india so that they also can taste what a flagship is let us not whine let other people also should enjoy the privilege of buying high end phones from reputable brand rather than buying from some cheap companies dont be like whiners initially we shout samsung phones very costly what the hell when samsung lowers the price we again shout samsung bad company they lowered the price samsung doesnt give lollipop rom fast when samsung gives than we shout why you have given kitkat was better  be grateful guys 6 samsung makes plastic phones what material will decide the technology seriously ok plastic have better network reception more durability lighter in weight remember our beloved nokia 3300  1100 all plastic throw them and they are again intact because of plastic only and mechanism of disamble as soon as it falls phone back cover battery opens thus distributing shock so the screen doesnt break so ill say its blessing in disguise i have 2 nexus and one iphone trust me a memory card is really a big deal your data is so secured whatever happens format service centre whatever s your sd card is there with all your data and as soon as you get phone youre ready and yes the white frost and black mist are too shiny and slippery so personally im also in love with deep black with leather back 7 theres no lollipop update for deep black yes at present theres no lollipop update for deep black edition only black mist and white frost model but it will come surely after a while i have updated my other phones with lollipop trust me theres lot of bug that will irritate you to the core so kindly wait for the proper build and bugs to be fixed even google lollipop has bugs today or tomorrow android 51 with bug fix coming to nexus and android one in india so kindly wait samsung will take time to clear all bugs may be months i would advice dont flash with lollipop now by going to service centre they are flashing white frost and black mist firmware theres only differnce of wallpaper and ringtone between other s4 and deep black 8 xiaomi mi4 lg g2 over plus one or samsung s4 very tricky question i have used mi3 trust me its pathetic cheap shiny material built looks like some kids have made the phone the fitting is not proper sim card doesnt eject properly so i dont expect much from xiaomi there are just better lava phones with good publicity department there rom miui is almost copy of ios and above all it has lot of bugs and service centre support is like nothing you can buy xiaomi phone but i would say only redmi kind phones for 5k 6k as a secondary smartphone lg g2 probably one of the best choice but price of g2 is still not stable it is better in every sense from camera to processor from battery to ui if you get for 2021k go for it without any doubts one plus one yeah its again a chinese phone but this one is seriously different from xiaomi and all awesome built brilliant screen better camera64 gb store good buy if you are in metro where you have customer service support also its 55 inch phone i like bit compact phone personal choice if you like big screen and you in metro go for it it has cyanogen mod support thats really a big deal actually cyanogen is better than google android though it is based on google android sundar pichai went to buy cyanogen but cyanogen still remains un owned samsung galaxy s 4  it has all features like full hd awesome camera and ok battery with plethora of service support so good buy for 18klollipop will be last official update for galaxys4 9galaxy s4 heats lot exactly it heats a lot coz the processor was half cooked samsung made a octa core which is actually 2 quad core its not octa core phone the two cores never work together if more fuel required task than 19ghz core works when less task than 12ghz core and in battery saving mode but theres no synchronization so many times it heats up a lot which is quite normal with all smart phone but s4 its more than other phones not a big deal just close your un wanted apps this phone has fast charging yes exactly the quick charge was experimented fast on this processor only with 2 amp charger its like turbo charger it has so many sensor never have been on any phone till date even it has humidity an temperature gauge these all features combined with thin body and 2 quad core processor makes this phone heats lot 10courier service and packaging was not good yes the courier and packaging is not as good as flipkart but amazon allows you to open the outer box to verify your inner phone box is good my package was damaged and amazon called me and asked me not to recieve this model and ordered for me one more with one day delivery and the 100 rs extra which i had to pay was credited to my wallet i would say always buy from flipkart and amazon they are most trusty and customer oriented e sellers in india  11will all normal s4 accessories fit in deep black yes almost all but few tight covers you have to apply more force than normal s4 12 should i buy s4 i have written everything related to this phone decision should be yours tomorrow youll come should i marry this girl or not take your decision that will only give you complete satisfaction and above all its just a phone if by chance you made wrong decision not a big deal sell it buy other samsung is facing a very big competition and its in a situation where it will be slaughtered by competition if it doesnt take immediate steps already it has been dethroned from all countries where it was number 1 and also in 5 years its profit is gone down and yesterdays report say its not number one smartphone seller in world it has been dethroned by apple iphone 6 success which is first time in like 7 years so samsung is changing all its policy like s 3 neo 12k for fighting micromax nitro and moto g and s4 for 18 k for fighting mi4 and one plus one does samsung galaxy s4 lags yeah it lags sometime specially in gallery other lag you can remove by one simple trick dibble click home button in that s voice will open just disable s voice through home button

2310	Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (White Frost)	got is for 16499 its march 2015 packing with mrp 19439 mentioned on the box best thing is u will get android lollipop 501 running out of the box
2311	Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (White Frost)	purchased this as a gift there was a slight scratch on the screen which i completely ignored as i needed the phone urgently but more than that the loliipop upgrade was a spoiler and totally made my phone a garbage the battery drains up in 23 hrs the phone heats up so bad and it hangs up showing a black screen and nothing seems to work i have to remove the battery and re start the phone again im not even using any heavy apps the memory usage is above 15gb everytime contacted amazon customer care but it was 14 days to my purchase and they said the return window is over i had been presuming that it comes with a 30 day return policy as per flipkart and amazon and totally unaware of 10 day return visited samsung customer care twice in 18 days and they just re installed my lollipop 501 there is no said time frame that a stable lollilop version will be received and samsung customer care cant even downgrade to the android version which three phone originally come with also the camera quality is really bad and here im struck with  a buggy phone neither the seller nor the manufacturer is of any help
2312	Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (White Frost)	i have been using galaxy s4 for past 2 years and my experience is not good cons 1 phone hangs a lot every android phone after 12 years gets slow and hangs very much try all tricks to optimize it buts no improvement 2 frequent apps restart  this issue is due to android 50 update like you are using some app and suddenly it will restart this is happening very frequently and its very frustrating no immediate solution from samsung 3heat very much  on playing game or using continuous for 1 hr its heats up very much 4 less available memory  from inbuilt 16 gb memory os itself takes 78 gb you left with only 8 gb of device storage 5 not for game lovers  big games like nfsasphaltcounter strike etc takes at least 15 gb device storage so after installing various appswhats app it store data in device storage you hardly left with 23 gb in which you can install only 12 games beware these games cant be moved to sd card they will remain in device storage only so after 12 years it become daily task to delete data to make space in device storage 6 camera  its 13 mp but not comparable to even iphone 5s very poor image in night 7 no future android update  it was launched in 2013 so most probably wont get any future os update after 2 years samsung does not provide os update so meaning to buying this now 8 no samsung support  no option in phonesamsung website to report an issue  pros  1 brand name 2 hd display 3 build quality  its 2 year old phone and now days many latest spec phone available in market in 1520 k range like one plus onemi4 so its not a good buy i would not recommend this to buy or would not recommend to buy any android phone same story after 2 years either buy for 152 years and then change or go for iphone its really awesome
2313	Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (White Frost)	the best mobile one can have for inr 16499 the things which i liked the most were 1 screen resolution 441 ppi is amazing 2camera13 mpx  3handy size5 inch screen size is very compact 4came with built in lollypop version which i didnt expect every mobile models will have its own drawbacksno one can show a single model with no single issuesdat too in androidthere is no way one can point his finger to a single perfect model every android models will have heating issue and battery draining issuei think this is what majority of people here are saying as drawbacks of s4yeah with such a high resolution and 2 quad core processors there will be battery draining and a bit of heating its normal for its specs how can we overcome that simply by reducing the screen brightness a little which in no way will affect ur clarity since the resolution is the highest in s4and putting in power save mode and turning off unnecessary air gestures and vibrationswhen not in needthis 2600 mah battery is definetly standing for a dayi mean frm mrng 6 am to evng 9 pmthis 15 hrs is the most one will use the mobilei guess simply don feed so many apps in ur mobile use what is absolutely necessary and delete all othersthis will somewhat help in reducing the heating issue i think apart from these two common issues there is no other issues worth mentioning here i think ill definetly say its worth the buy

2320	Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (White Frost)	i must say that this is the best phone under 20000 bucks one can get though there are other phones which have 4gb ram or snapdragon but they all miss one legendary feature air gesture and air view samsungs own new phone series the a  e are available under 25000 which do not offer infrared gesture sensor simply the best if we compare it to the similar priced galaxy e5 we get 5gb extra ram plus an extra 16 ghz 4 core processor 13 mp camera gesture sensor android l better display density premium look and feel s view cover thermometer hygrometer ir blaster support for wireless charging otg support and much more at just a similar price dont think just go for it no complaints at all with the device except it gets a bit over heated while charging
2321	Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (White Frost)	i got this at rs 14999 with benefit of sbi card during the sale at this price a full hd screen and other features are quite a deal you may get mi4i etc slightly cheaper but reliability of samsung brand at this price is great i have been now using it for around a month and find no issues sometimes it lags while playing games but in general operations there is no problem it heats up while charging but in general usage there is no problem camera is good and daylight photos and videos are great dim light photographs are good but not great i will be upgrading it to android lolipop version and then will see if there is any change in performance battery is decent and lasts for one full day with normal usage
2322	Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (White Frost)	awesome phone at such a low price i bought it at 16529 included gift wrap nice price given by amazon while other websites are selling at 29000 great phn especially camerasound and fast charging are awesome features go for it guys just one tip as soon as u get the phn go to service centre and update even thoigh it is lollipop when i went to samsung sc they told me never update ur phn manually by wifi u should always go and update from samsung sc no problem with lollipop 501 battery also works for long time and best feature is fast charging normal heating which every smartphn will have it only heats at bottom of back camera go for it guys best buy thank u amazon
2323	Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-I9500 (White Frost)	never expected these many drawbacks getting heated up unless i siwtchoff the mobile lollipop updation has drained all the features please dont buy this model you will obviously get disappointed im sure you have better choice on the same price

2340	Samsung Galaxy E7 (Black)	i got this mobile few days back for 194k from samsung shop the battery life of this phone is awesome it simply last for 48 hoursthe camera is so good the quality of photos are much better than mi4
2341	Samsung Galaxy E7 (Black)	this review is based on 15 days of phone usage i got from a store and not from amazon  well you know the specs of the phone usage results  battery  excellent backup in normal usage 2 complete days 48 hrs backup after full battery charge and you wont believe that i got 30 battery left 9786 thanks to 2950mah battery by normal usage i meant  playing games social apps calls music  games  this lovely thing plays almost anything with absolutely no lag i play high end games like brothers in arms 3 fifa 14 asphalt 8 etc and of course basic ones like temple run 2 subway surfer etc  touch is super smooth with less delay being a sony fan i was in an impression that they make best touch in smart phones i was wrong now i am an e7 samsung fan lovely  camera  out of the world special treat for selfie lovers  it got voice command and palm gesture option to take selfies that means you dont need to struggle to reach the screen for taking selfie just show your palm and the phone will sense it and take selfie and yes they got wide angle selfie to cover your entire family or friends onto a single frame awesome feature note  by default the front and rear cam resolutions are 39mb and 96mb respectively 169 you can change to 13mp and 5mp in the camera settings  they are 2 cons that some people might not like in this phone i dont have any issue with that though  1 sd card and sim 2 are the same port i meant you cannot use dual sim and memory card at the same time you can either use single sim and memory card or dual sim with no memory card 2 non removable battery  audio is bit less when you play music movies speaker is near the camera on the top i hope i explained the main features of the phone drop me a question if you have any other queries  overall an excellent buy it is slim and light weight too cheers
2342	Samsung Galaxy E7 (Black)	the product is an absolute gemdont think twicecurrent it has stock rom as kitkat with confirmed upgrade to lollipop i was thinking between this and note 3 neo but the note 3 neo was a bit thickalso this is the latest model mar 15 one more thing i got this blue colour for rs 18500 at a retail storeso enquire twice before u buy online also since this is samsung u r guaranteed after sales support even in the smallest of towns

2347	Samsung Galaxy E7 (Black)	its more then 2 weeks now since i purchased this super phone  initially i thought the battery is draining out quick but later found out that it was because of the app i installed  once i uninstalled it  i was able to enjoy the real performance of this master piece   very good in all aspects  i recommend
2348	Samsung Galaxy E7 (Black)	using this phone for a weekmy reviews 1 display  superb quality just that there is no auto brightness 2 sound  ok quality and a bit low 3 performance  snappy u wont feel any lags in games or day to day operations and doesnt get hot 4 battery  awesomefor medium to heavy usage 15 days for normal usage easily 2 days 5 looks  really great and slim55 inch screen looks beautiful 6price  well they launched at 23k but now u get at 186k so it justify the price for 55inch screen and dual sim version  in my opinion if u want that funky fonts and super amoled display with great samsung service and also at lesser pricedont think again about this product just buy it you wont regret competitors  htc desire 820 product is great but you know the pathetic htc service also product is pricey
2349	Samsung Galaxy E7 (Black)	super mobile device i bought it for my wife and we are very happy with this phone specially for the price it looks better than the regular samsung mobiles and the configuration is fab

2354	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Green, Dual SIM)	i bought this 1 month ago and product seems to be good but this has few major defects that camera does not have zoom capability and sometimes mobile is getting hang even though i have not installed any games etc
2355	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Green, Dual SIM)	i bought this mobile for my uncle what made me consider buying this over other smartphones like redmi note yureka etc is that windows phone is pretty much fool proof it can be quite easy to operate for someone who is new and barely understands smartphones plus he trusts nokia over chinese xiaomi and micromax also this is the first lumia that inherits the microsoft badge here are some of the pros and cons of this phone  pros runs on latest windows phone direct updates from microsoft like nexus in case of google  has been confirmed that it will get windows 10 update  has user replaceable covers and battery  supports expandable storage with microsd  front cam is 5mp for great quality selfies and skype calls  dual sim  lag is minimal  cons biggest con is that the touchscreen is which is defective microsoft have announced that an update can rectify this but even after installing each and every update released till date there has been no improvements it misses touches sometimes it takes unintended touches somestimes gestures are misinterpreted even phones much cheaper have better touch screens than this  5mp cam is not capable of recording even 720p videos maybe its because of weaker processor  lack of apps which is a limitation of os not just this phone
2356	Microsoft Lumia 535 (Green, Dual SIM)	sir the phone is not upto the mark it is getting heated up and hanging very often

2390	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	hi i bought this phone in dec2014  it hangs everyday atleast 10 times in a day  first its giving blue screen and then gets restarted automatically you loose every thing you are doing  pathetic phone dont buy this by just looking at specs  samsung service centers are worst  they refreshed software 3 timesnow thinking they will do some hardware part change but their internal systems are down from 12days  so they cant help me  they are not ready for replacement  samsung mobile  are worst
2391	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	please note below are just my own opinion and i dont want anyone to follow my opinion blindly please take your own decision  34in india with current infrastructure we should not go with higher end model and honestly speaking you will not notice any differences between grand2 and s5 in fact grand2 has bigger screen than s534
2392	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	samsung galaxy grand 2 is an upgrade to the already popular galaxy grand released in 2013 this has better specs comparing to the older grandand definitely performs better   highlights and comparison   62 quadcore 12ghz snapdragon 400 processor and adreno 305  same combination seen in budget devices like moto g and xolo q1100  62 15 gb of ram which is goodbut devices from xolo and micromax priced under 20k ships with 2gb of ram 62 2600mah battery under rs 20000 xolo q3000 ships with 4000mah battery  62 display  720 x 1280 pixels 525 inches 280 ppi pixel density is far better than the original grand shipped last yearstill not the best you can get for the price display is highly reflective and the viewing angles are not the best 62 performance  the performance of the device is the same as you can get on the under rs15000 moto g this has the same processorgpu combination and the gaming performance is quite goodyou may hit some lags when playing high end hd games though 15gb of ram makes multitasking a breeze 62 8gb of internal storage of which 57 gb is user accessible you can move apps to the sdcard 62 camera quality is quite goodbut not that great like you seen on samsung galaxy note 3 or galaxy s4   benchmark scores  antutu score  16900 nenamark 2  56fps quadrant  8400  this has got really good internal specs and the processing power is more than enough for your day to day needs since this has the heavy touchwiz ui on top of android 43occasionally you are gonna face with some lags here and there apart from thatthe device performs really well  when looking at other devices with same specs samsung galaxy grand 2 is a little overprizedbut for this extra money you are paying you get more software features like multiwindow  mircomax canvas knight which comes with an octa core processor2gb ram etc is only priced under rs 20000 which makes it a better grab than thisif you are ok with a device with no micro sdcard slot and an average camera cheaper moto g is a great buy one other similar device is xolo q1100 with micro sdcard slot and running stock android 43 out of the box
2393	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	the mobile came with out kit kat version so we have suffered to update it
2394	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	i have used the device for 10 daysand tried almost all apps i wanted too so here is the comprehensive review of the product  battery life really good mine giving 15 days backup once fully charged  display though not the bestbut still very good size matters and the large size gives it advantage when it comes to reading news ebooks etc  sound this device produces best music i have ever heard in a phone only my cowon d2 provides a better headset sound than this plus the unique features like sound adapt which customizes the sound as per the headphoneheadset lyrics integration smart equalizer and voice commands for audio playback seriously improves the user experience  dont use third party music players like player pro or poweramp as the stock music player is best i have tried them all and ultimately uninstalled them despite having an full version purchased for my earlier devices  hardware i am using 16 screen widgets which need constant data from rss feeds apart from the 112 downloaded applications still the phone is still working smooth and nice now beyond this i dont want some torture tests as i have installed all the useful applications i need  design hope samsung is reading they really need to change the 3 years old design theme each phone from s1 to ace to core to s4 and this looks same please change this design policy and provide some cool new designs i would suggest people to buy lf szlf back case cover with bumper for this phone it would provide ample protection and would seriously improve the grip and appearance of the gadget  extra features multi windows which was first provided in note 3 is there and its a really cool feature check youtube for this feature  sound adapt smart equalizer stock battery save mode and story album new app exclusive to samsung note 3 and grand 2  suggestions for buyers buy matte screen guard instead of clear as matte really suits this device buy portronics stylus as again this particular stylus suits it best and finally buy lf szlf case cover or flip cover  verdict a really good gadget
2395	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	if size of the set is reduced little bit then it is okay application is easy to handle battery drain fast as a pastor for me the set is worth because on busy schedule i could contact people on different application i recommend those who are looking for a dual sim and travel frequently to different places grand 2 is worth 
2396	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	an excellent product at such a reasonable price which has made the whole family excitingthe cashback on top is just fabolus  but the real surprise was the complimentary freecharge couponsi couldnt get this product any cheaper than this site
2397	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	awesome product with awesome features im using this peoduct from past 5 months now again i booked one again for my friend the main thing i like in this phone is the battery backup my phone will always connected to wifi network in my home as well as my office and i can use more than 35 hours after full charge the processor is awesome high graphic intensive games can play without any lag only one thing that im not happy with d device is the internal 8gb memory im a great fond of games some times d 8 gb internal will not b sufficient for installing more than 2 high graphic intensive gamesupto 64 gb it will support
2398	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	after success of grand 1 this is good upgrade in this segment however one might argue that this is overpriced but apart from this phone looks great ram is 15 gb which gives nice experience while working wifi mobiledata call quality are good camera and sound quality are ok loudspeaker volume should have been more screen size is optimum i have other phones as well having size greater and lesser that this and i find this one in correct size battery is very good
2399	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	grand 2 is best phone of this 2014 under buget 25000
2400	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	the product is excellent i had bought it for my wife she feels is extremely readable and a definite upgrade for her the speed is very good to as it the graphic quality
2401	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	im using this phone from past 3 months and i have not faced  any problem display is awesome and it never got hanged this is completely different phone and lot of efforts wad put in to improve the specs only problem is battery if you use 3g then it will drains our in half a day i would recommend for the one who is looking to buy a big screen phone
2402	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	very good smart phone better than the one i was using earlier the service facility is available in my home town
2403	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	it has got all the features which i expecteddesignsamsung brand performance if your budget is under 20k then this is probably the best phone you will get before buying it i went through all the review sites and i am happy that i choose the right product it was my first experience with amazon i received my phone in 2 days that is too without any glitches overall buying  process was very smooth and i must admit i loved the amazon service hope to make a purchase soon with amazon
2404	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	it has been 6 months now that i have been using this phone  the phone is great feels good it hand  the faux leather print on the back feels premium the phone is good at multi tasking though it can lag sometimes  but one big problem i am having with this phone is that the battery drains down pretty quickly and also the phone sometimes heats up to an extent that it has to be switched off for some time  overall a good phone with average specs you can try the moto g gen 2 instead of this also
2405	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	fantastic phone that has top class samsung features bought this in amazon sale for a bargain 13000 considering freecharge vouchers of 2500 and cashback  pros display size and touch response are great ram and speed are good enough upgrades to kitkat immediately even if it comes with jellybean  cons heats up a little when in 3g mode for longer period of times may be due to custom cover that i use as well not sure display in sunlight is bad
2406	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	display was not working within 10 daysi had 2 get the display replaced  from samsung service center product is not made of quality
2407	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	being the first time buying anything online i was a bit apprehensive about the the quality of the product being delivered but  after receiving the phone all apprehensions gone the product was a brand new and really package well so that phone doesnt get damaged great packaging great product timely delivery perfectly on  time in short complete satisfaction
2408	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	it really has a great smartphone from samsung  having best hd display better connectivity camera is helpful  to catch best image big display viewing angle is too good nd best battery backup with kitkatat androidtoo much entertainment
2409	Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 (Black)	the phone is excellent compared to s4 moto x this is worth for price 64 gb expandability and removable battery are added plus canera quality also good installed several apps from googleplay without any performance issues using the phone since past 2 weeksdidnt find any specific negative so far thus rating high in 20k range this is high performing great phone go for it without further confusion goodluck
2410	Micromax Bolt D320 (Black)	all the features of this phone are awesome in such a low price range but the voice audible while talking is very poor sometimes tough to believe that whether the person talking to is realy the same whom i have called another problem is with its ringtone quality which is very low for rest the phone is superb suggest to definitely go for it if your budget is low and expectation is high
2411	Micromax Bolt D320 (Black)	at this price this mobile is a great product  though i am bit disappointed to see that only one speaker is provided on the front and thats for both calling and loud musicsound etc
2412	Micromax Bolt D320 (Black)	in this price range the product is ok but missing speaker make problem in incoming call alert and also cant use loudspeaker mode
2413	Micromax Bolt D320 (Black)	gud fone just amazing at this rate thanx amazon for faster and quick service
2414	Micromax Bolt D320 (Black)	better price available
2415	Lava Iris X8 (White, 2GB RAM, 16GB)	if you are on alookout for a phone that does almost everything seamless and also looks good but is economical as well  this is the phone superb interface great battery life and joy to use same specs in a samsung phone would be not less than 25k but this phone under 10 k is does the trick

2418	Lava Iris X8 (White, 2GB RAM, 16GB)	music lovers beware  keep away from sht it has super crap headphones bundled the sound hardware also appears substandard compared to a low end handset like lava iris 405 sound quality is cheap compared to iris 405 which i used for 2 years that has superb bass reproduction on equalizing sound i tried several audio players and still the sound quality is low lava what the heck is this  gallery software is buggy no magneto meter even a basic touch screen handset has it no orientation sensor it has good things too average battery lasts a day on medium internet browsing and some voice calls it is boasting of 8 processing cores but god knows how much is the performance mediatek hardware is inferior to qualcomm so cant expect performance compared to yu yureka  definitely not a value for money i say omg i cant stop saying sound quality is crappy

2435	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	xolo a500s ips is a budget android under 7k device this phone is same as the xolo a500sthe only difference being the screenthis has a better ips screenold one came with a tft screen   key highlightspros and cons   well designed  mediatek mt6572w dual core processor  decent processorperformancewise not as good as mtk6589 quadcore  512 mb ram  enough for your basic apps usagebut not great for gaming and multitasking  480 x 800 pixels 40 inches 233 ppi pixel density pretty decent for the price  viewing angles are oknot that great  dual sim  camera  average quality nothing to be excited aboutexpect some blurry images often front camera can be used for video calling in well lighted areas only  music quality coming out of the speakers is not goodheadsets coming with the phone is of average quality  3g speeds  211 mbps hsdpa 56 mbps hsupa  operating system  android os v42 jelly beannot the latest versionbut visually there isnt much difference from 43 or 44 android  battery  liion 1400 mah battery  not great it cant even last a day 23 hours screen on time with wifi3g data on  performance and gaming  the processor and gpu on board is capable of playing basic popular games like temple runsubway surfers etcbut expect lags if you have a lot of apps installed and they are occupying the memory  verdict  this phone is good if you are planning to use only a few appslike whatsappfacebook etc dont buy this for using high end apps gaming or for camera performance
2436	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	pros  its been a month and till now all good id like to give suggestion on cons as pros you guyz know  cons  1 camera is not actually 5megapixel led is useless still iam satisfied with the quality of the product  better than average    2 ram is not actually sufficient but if you want more than than go for higher range mobiles   3 games do lag sometimes   4 battery is good depends upon the usage as for my view every android needs to be recharged once per day so no big issue  low on budget go for it best you can get in this range
2437	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	this is a very good phone and value for money only reason for giving 3 stars and not 4 is the overall sound quality is not good it cannot be used as a mp3 player while traveling the speaker volume for mp3 music ringtones is also low and if tv volume is moderate the incoming call may not be audible the incoming call ringtone volume issue may not be applicable for the inbuilt ring tones as they were pretty loud  i like this phone if they work on the sound issue i will definitely buy the next iteration of this phone
2438	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	i received it yesterday and planned to write a review after using it i havent seen any lag even while playing games like asphalt subway surfers  battery backup is also good i charged it fully once and been using it with above moderate usage 1hr gaming 1hr whatsapp few calls and browsing so you can easily get a day of backup with moderate usage  only concern is android 422 it would be nice if xolo releases updates
2439	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	look is very stylish with good features   all features are good except sound quality when lisening music overall recommend for purchase 128077
2440	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	xolo a500s ips is a smartphone specially oriented for budget conscious buyers and for all who would like to take advantage of the new features of android jellybean the dual sim phone consist of 12 ghz dual core processor 512 mb ram 4 gb disk space android jellybean 422 few xolo branded apps including readymade themes code named xthemes  even though the phone has 4 gb of internal storage only 12 gb is usable which means android jelly bean consumes more disk space however you can expand the memory to 32 gb using micro sd card  xolo a500s ips which i am using it for last 7 months will take few minutes to boot up initially moreover i didnt notice any abnormal heat during charging and when playing games the phone is very much light weight and doesn8217t feel heavy for your pockets  the thickness of xolo a500s ips is less when compared to other competing phones and games such as temple run subway surfers asphalt works fine and fast the device has got a great non slippery back panel the functionality of primary and secondary cameras is average similar to that of other similar category phones  the display of the phone is not that much good despite ips screen as it is too reflective when placed under light i had to position it in a particular angle to work with the phone moreover i didn8217t like the placement of lock and volume buttons this is because if you lock the phone then volume button will also be pressed unless you take care of it  i am very much disappointed with the quality of speakers i must say that speaker is not audible when the phone is placed on the desk however the volume is better when the phone is kept on the hand  the default ringtones included with the phone are not audible if you place xolo a500s ips and switch on the tv or some other audible stuff then you will not be able to clearly hear the ringtone the sound is audible only if phone is placed on the same room  i was surprised when i saw blue screen of death with some unknown commands after one week of purchase the phone worked properly only when i took the battery out and placed it after a minute  i found that the length of xolo a500s ips is big when compared with other 4 inch phones  the battery backup of the device is average and cannot be said to be great i am not a heavy user and the battery lasted around 2 days when used without wifi and bluetooth however if you play games and make use of internet you will have to charge the phone once every day  i also noticed that if i didnt charge the battery for long time you will have to take the battery out and place it again i had done this once when the phone behaved abnormally during charging  the phone ships with one screen guard affixed to it besides headphone usb charger and a small pocket manual i would suggest the manufacturer to include a small note that the screen guard has already been affixed to the phone so that users will not tamper with the other screen guard inside the package  if you want a basic light weight android phone then xolo a500s ips is an excellent choice i really dont know about the quality of service centres but i will be happy as long as the device works fine the device can also be used as a mini tablet for email checking browsing and listening to mild music on the go  xolo a500s ips is good but the price is fluctuating on amazonin sometimes you will see 4999 but sometimes 5999 the price of the phone should be around 4000 because we can easily purchase a 5 inch phone for rs 5000 price range  nowadays people are more inclined towards bigger mobile than small size 4 inches
2441	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	it is very good phone below 10000 its camera and internet speed goodbut poor batteryall over its good phone wow
2442	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	xolo a500 ips mobile nice mobile but some defaults are therebattery is not good4gb internal memory not availablebut in low price smart mobiles this product is goodsamsung s duos all options are there in this mobile

2444	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	amazing phone at amazing price  it meet all my expectations like  sleek and handy  supports 3g and play full hd movies  decent sound  good compare to other smartphone 1 day battery backup very good camera 5mp mainly it supports normal sim not micro sim and nano simoverall i am very satisfied for buying this at very reasonable offer price  4699 rs onlyi can assure u this is the best u can get under 5000rs dont think go for it 
2445	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	in one month time the cell stopped working as it was under warranty gave it for repair xolo service center took 2 months for repair and they received the cell with broken display so they send it back to company and they replied me that company has stopped the production that this model and gave a different model cell which has a less market cost its a case of cheating my xolo company guys never buy xolo cell phone
2446	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	phone puchased online through amazonin this month received delivery before the specific date mentioned though the phone is being used by my son i come to know that the same is worth considering its cost and is functioning well my son is fully satisfied with the phone service so far from the date of its receipt the clarity and camera of the phone is marvelous
2447	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	this is perfect match for me its giving long battery backup even 5 hrs continue browsing better video resolution once phone memory getting 70 full  phone is slightly hanging so i removed 20 then no hanging problem the worst issue is the charger its take too long to battery full i tried with other charger its quickly charging overall i can give 7 out of 10
2448	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	ive placed the order for this phone on 7th of jan ive seen this fone personally at my friend and found it attractive small and budget fone  i like things to be small and comfortable in hands so im purchasing this im hoping the fone meet my expectations  thanks for the above reviewers the comments are helpful
2449	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	poor low ringtone volume cant hear the ringtone once we get out of home and also cant opt for vibrating ringtone since the battery is weak but other things are okay as for its price sometimes the addressbooks not show the number and people if we want 98943  but if the added as 9198943 its cant find the name
2450	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	good product with reasonable price strongly preffered for buying only con is ram if it was 1 gb then could the best of best
2451	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	best phone in this price camera and key board is problem but rest is all good recommended suggested voted vu
2452	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	this phone is compatible for me it looks so smart it supports high quality videos its video recording is also very good but as i expected its led flash is not so powerful at night the camera cannot shot a clear photo another drawback is its gaming feature some games are not played well
2453	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	i will discuss cons first  1 using data consumes lot of battery but if u are planning to use on wifi then it is sufficient  otherwise it is a decent phone for mild user with its light weight and slim profile you will not feel it in your pocket
2454	Xolo A500s IPS (Black)	kam price me best phone hai 7 month se mai use kar raha ho koi damage nahi hai internet speed kaphi acchi hai wifi ke sath gps navigation accha chalta hai battery backup achha hai sath hi display ka resolutoin accha hai camera bhi best quality ka hai

2468	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	this phone has proven quite reliable ever since i have received it  1 adequate battery back up 2 games like asphalt are running smooth 3 phone has fallen a few times from my hands but no scratches
2469	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	product is okay but not great camera is not good the product shape and size weight are great the custom os is not great gesture features are not good i would rate huawei 8gb better
2470	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	when we play games or browsing for 15mins it is gettign too hot  apart from that it is awesome mobile slim and good to handle  good  front camera to take selfie
2471	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	dis is the phone i was waiting for totally worth the money no screen lag great front camera skype running smooth and full hd screen is awesome
2472	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	worth in no heating issues no single issue battery backup normal fast processor  2gb ram good light weight nice design  but not worth  camera  useless imx 214 sensor from sony no security software   like antivirus personal app locks etc as like mi lot of bugs need to be fixed in built in apps
2473	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	given its price i must say phicomm passion has beaten all the rivals it would be wrong if you start comparing it with high end devices by other giants however its fresh and good enough not to mention it is only 110 grams including battery and this is awesome all it need an update to lollipop and rest would be history
2474	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	its a good phone with best specifications and fantastic ui but battery backup is very low iam getting low battery for 4  5 hours of usage on wifi for just normal web surfing facebook  whats app i didnt have a guts to use it on 4g or playing heavy graphic games  scared on battery backup  rest all are as they claim
2475	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	performance  the p660 running on snapdragon 615 octacore with clocking speed 12 ghz and 2gb of ram 1916mb available  with 16 gb internal storage capacity better graphics support i got antutu score of 23653  the screen  the p660 comes with a 5 inch 1080p full hd ips lcd screen giving better view even in the daylight on low brightness  it gives a natural color production  the battery  2300 mah battery is not enough for one day for a regular smartphone user we can see the battery decreasing on the status bar really disappointed on battery  back camera 13 mp average output with a lot of noise if there is low light i purchased this because of its very lightweight 110 gms
2476	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	i have been using this phone for about a week now and i can give you guys some info on it  1 it gets warm if a lot of apps are open at the same time but does not heat up too much  2 the camera can take very good pictures  and the autofocus feature is great will share pictures soon  3 battery performance is ok i survive one entire day at work without needing to charge it  4 there are no scratches on the body despite many falls lives up to the claim of antiscratch  5 it has this cool feature of vibrate upon cal response which has been extremely useful for me as i forget about calls after dialing some times  overall this phone has delivered more than i expected from it
2477	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	very bad battery backup  and bad sound vibration
2478	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	i was a little apprehensive while buying this product i needed a phone immediately and this was the latest launchd one  but i have been using it for a few days niw and i have seen few things  1 does not have any heating issues unlike other phones 2 screen resilution is very good 3 battery is more than enough  overall happy with purchase
2479	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	in my opinion this is the best phone one can get in the range near 10000 i bought this phone for my brother and he has been hooked on to it all day i noticed that he has stopped watching youtube on his laptop and is glued to the youtube app on his phone probably owing to the phones full hd screen the hardware also seems quite solid
2480	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	excellent product  camera quality is too good  after update the new sw if you hold the phone in hand grip of phone is good i like front camera where you can take more people selfie in one time
2481	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	sound quality is very bad
2482	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	not sure what other buyers are talking about battery life is fantastic phone is sleek as hell light as a feather and has got some serious power in it havent faced any problems with it superb phone
2483	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	just received this phone a few days back prompt delivery service from amazon reached in less than 24 hours  about the phone phicomm has done a good job of understanding the indian consumer this is not a basic smart phone with its features it is an aspirational product i think its ahead of the game for now as it does not claim to be like its competition who else gives you a 13 megapixel camera barometer pedometer metal alloy antiscratch shell and a full hd display at this price  of course these are just first impressions i will keep posting on this thread as i discover more about this phone
2484	PHICOMM Passion 660 (Black)	battery is horrible just 5 hrs 2g talk time and 25 hrs net browsing a moderate user needs to charge it 2 to 3 times a day for 11000 rupees it is not worth  phicomm has given such a good specification but they have not realized the importance of battery backup also the battery is non removable hence no chance of carrying additional battery phicomm should take steps to replace the existing battery to at least 3000 mah  not to go for this until the battery backup improves
2485	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Champagne Gold)	with the a series we can conclude that samsung is trying to sort out the design problems it has had for years with the galaxy alpha the metal body was introduced in samsung phones but the back was still made of plastic but a series features full unibody design which gives the phone a sturdy feelsturdy yet not premium the ram is plenty for a phone but what seems to be a point of concern here is the processor which is comparable to the processors of a few android wearquadcore 12 ghz cortexa53 what that means is that while the phone feels snappy in daily tasks its exhibits a lacklustre performance in resource hogging tasks like gaming a great new feature is that the micro sd card slot doubles as a sim card slot to make the phone dual sim but that features compromises expandable memoryso to sum it up   pros 1 sturdy build 2 2gb ram 3 interchangeable micro sdup to 64gbdual sim card slot 4 nice camera13 mp rear and 5 mp front with features like wide frame selfies and animated gif selfies 5 super slim67mm 6 corning gorilla glass 4 7 battery lasts a day no issue though it is a 2300liion mah battery this is because both the screen and the processor are not as powerful so they could do well with less juice  cons 1 mediocre screen720p screen in year 2015 though its 294 ppi and its still difficult to spot pixels from a practical distance in 720p screen still higher resolution produces more vivid and sharp images though it is more taxing on the battery which becomes somewhat significant here as the battery is less powerful 2 less powerful processorquadcore 12 ghz cortexa53 3 sound is not good samsung should have put the speakers on the side rather than on the back 4 otg not supported 5 android 444 out of the boxan update may be on its way 6 metal back is prone to scratches 7 high price for the specifications  bottomline this phone has almost the same specifications as lenovo a6000 but is more costly the sturdy build and slim form factor makes the phone feel good in hand but still lacks a premium touch the camera is good and the comparable brother is galaxy s5 except for the fact that this phone is 12 ghz quad while s5 has 25 ghz quad core processor so while this phone is launched recently still it would be a better choice to stretch the budget a little bit and buy the s5 as this phone brings nothing exceptionally appealing to the table except for a sturdy design and a undue price
2486	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Champagne Gold)	awesome build quality superb phone this phone is a tough competetor to iphone 5s due to its metal design the features are superb the phone is superbly smooth superb cameras with loaded features ui is awesome too

2503	Xolo Win Q900S (Black)	xolo win q9000 is a light weight windows mobile  good screen brightness touch sensitiveness etc  it is very handy too  the only problem with xolo is that the updates are not released  microsoft has relesed 2 versions upgrade in windows 81  which will support trucaller and some other apps  but this will not run in xolo mobile as we dont get updates  so i will not suggest even my enemy to buy this  better go for a microsoft mobile if you are interested in windows phone

2513	Xolo Win Q900S (Black)	exxagerated specifications phone doesnt actually support 720p quality of videos thus the full hd screenas said doesnt make any difference id recommend not to buy this phone the performace doesnt match the specs as said
2514	Xolo Win Q900S (Black)	win q900s doesnt promise as expected there are so many problems with the phone as i have experienced by using it  i ordered the phone on 13th october and got it by 17th october i have experienced some good things and also some equal bad things  problems i have faced are  1camera is not even comparable to a 3mp camera rear camera is really very bad in medium or low light and fine only in very good daylight not nighttime even if it has very good light front camera cant even be compared to a vga camera tats how it is so if u r into a camera phone or a phone wit normal camera option i wont suggest this phone better forget the camera option if u r buying this phone  2it does have network connection problems it shows apps like whatsapp cant connect repeatedly unless i open it den only i can receive the messages that were sent back like 2 days ago even the 3g connection is on for 247  3another problem tat should be taken care of is the sound quality tat gets drastically reduced when calling others and cant even hear the other persons voice properly n i had to use loudspeaker only to hear the voice  4on the very first day battery withstanded upto 7 hours even though i didnt use the apps or any other things battery usage after 2 days using apps and others cant even withstand 4 or 5 hours normal usage gives the battery upto 7 or 8 hours at the max  5phone sometimes lags i read so many reviews in here and other websites saying that this phone doesnt lag but i had that rough experience after 4 days sometimes when u simultaneously go through apps u might get this wilder experience and also when u r playing games like subway surfer or temple run or any other equal games  6when transferring files via bluetooth i experienced that not more than 3 files cant be transferred to other devices at a time and the bluetooth connection gets closed after that automatically i tried multiple times with different phones but got the same result  pros are  1 good user interface 2 friendly and easy to use device just like nokia lumia series 3 smooth touch experience 4 great customization features 5 very good windows experience  finally i have to say that apart from windows experience the phone lacks so many good things
2515	Xolo Win Q900S (Black)	nice brand its best from another windows mobiles
2516	Xolo Win Q900S (Black)	from first day on wards receiver has some disturbanceafter 4 days receiver is not working at all all calls are managing with speaker i need a solution for it

2518	Xolo Win Q900S (Black)	i really enjoy this product this looks damn good and worthy for money the design and the main highlight of the phone is the weight
2519	Xolo Win Q900S (Black)	amazon service is good but it does not have compass magnetometer as shown in xolo site and amazon as wellwhat8217s the need to show fake things cheap strategy very disappointed by missing feature of compass phone is good as using from 5 days

2524	Gionee M2 (Black, 8GB)	awsum phone with sexy battery back i preferred my frnds to buy its phone in range of 10000 camera features are awsum its has touch shot autofocus eraser mode n many more like frame shot and you can change keypad theme according to your choice its best in this range it doesnt heat it heats untill u use it over like u using internetcallgame at the same time on charging then its goes heat which is common whether u take i phone also so guys i prefer dont go on company names coz all comp made there phones in china dont believe just look your old android phone u will see n search gionee on google u will find the difference its popular in many countries where samsung failed  thank u for reading such a long message
2525	Gionee M2 (Black, 8GB)	i have purchased this mobile gionee m2 one month back really this is an excellent option at this price 4200 mah mammoth battery is the main advantage losts two days even if u browse continuesly rare camera is pretty good front is not bad video recording is excellent it is dual sim gsmgsm 2nd sim slot is micro phone is not at all heating up even  if u talk continuesly for 2 hours internal memory is 8 gb loaded with lots of pre installed apps but u can uninstall useless ones phone is bit heavy 200 grmsbecause of huge battery but i like it i am enjoying using this mobile i will give 5 star
2526	Gionee M2 (Black, 8GB)	i got this phone as a birthday gift for my dad who had been reluctant to switch from his old feature phone to the world of smartphones  as his first smartphone and knowing his stubby fingers and tendency to drop things i wanted something that was largescreened and sturdy  another requirement was good battery life as i could see my dad not bothering to charge his phone every single day  this phone has turned out to be an excellent purchase seeing as one charge lasts him 2 days easily its very easy to use doesnt lag whatsoever doesnt do any funny things the screen is big which makes typing for him easy and the phone though heavy feels solid in hand which is reassuring  i dont think i could have found a better phone than this for my dad and though i was initially skeptical about how my dad would accept it he absolutely loves it and is inseparable from it  the cameras though high in megapixels arent great but thats not a problem for us since my dad is not fond of taking pics anyway if youre looking for a great camera you should look elsewhere  but if any of you is looking for a phone that you can simply buy and forget and which will keep serving you like a reliable workhorse i suggest you go for this one  and if you are also aiming to help your father get into the smartphone space you probably wont find a better place to start  the package contained a magnetic flip cover as well as two screen guards all of it for around 10k  honestly no complaints whatsoever here 
2527	Gionee M2 (Black, 8GB)	i bought this phone 4 days back looks absolutely fine with processing sound quality battery features and many more other options camera is given 8 mp but quality is not like that also little bit heavy but overall good quality phone at this price range

2530	Gionee M2 (Black, 8GB)	ya good phone but camera is not good low colours this is not a slim phone over all its good
2531	Gionee M2 (Black, 8GB)	at 10k this phone serves as a handy communication instrument i have been using it for three months and must say that the high battery life nails it the screen resolution will be a problem if you are an extensive video viewer and the phone speakers are not placed correctly sometimes i cant hear the ring
2532	Gionee M2 (Black, 8GB)	phone is okay but it is not light weight too heavy otherwise it is best phone
2533	Gionee M2 (Black, 8GB)	the features are excellent and had no issues using it so far only the kitkat update had to be updated manually after this all the updates have been ota with minimal use per day the battery is lasting over 8 days using it as a backup phone
2534	Gionee M2 (Black, 8GB)	amazing smart phone with an amazing battery back up ordered this phone on the 28th september with a two day delivery route for receiving it on 30th september 2014 and was equally amazed to receive it one day ahead of schedule on 29th september 2014 an excellent service from amazon as usual have used the phone for last three days and found it to be excellent in all departmentsa top class smart phone from gionee with an amazing battery back up of 36 to 48 hours on 2g3gwifi usage this is a great phone and im loving it other than the weight which is heavy because of the battery i cant find any other critical con ive got the 8 gb version and hence dont have an storage problem the 8 mp back camera is also very good the 35 mm audio input port is also okay and accepts all the earphones i have tried with out any problem the supplied earphones charger and screen guard are also okay the supplied supposed to be case cover is only for show and does not serve any useful purpose it does help in covering the phone while carrying it in the hand but does not serve as as a flip cover i have purchased my own flip cover lastly thanks to amazon for their excellent service

2561	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	i have all three phones concurrently and would like give an review based on my experience with all three devices but focusing on the passport primarily when they tell you that the passport is a productivity machine i have to agree with the categorization the hub is awesome i have all my mail accounts including whatsapp linked facebook instagram igrann pro google chat etc i hear people say is that not an information overload on the hub the answer is actually no this is because you can choose to see what is always displayed and accounts that are displayed when you select them  mail  is butter smooth i cannot say how much better it is than the gmail app on the htc m8 or the mail app on the iphone 6 the issue i have with gmail on the htcandroid in general is that if you have non gmail accounts you have to rely on the mail app which is  pretty poor and laggy mail on ios 8xx is an improvement but you still get the message cannot download at this time but it does have some nifty features like recognising tracking numbers and dates for appointments etc the testament of how good the hub is that even when i in from of my computer i look to reply to emails using my passport also the keyboard has a part to play here the email on the bb is clear and i actually am able to read some reports that i get instead of skimming them as i do both on the m8 and the iphone 6this for me is priceless  the passport is a couple of evolutions ahead of the competition  other messaging  here again while the fact that whatsapp on iphone and android are able to compress large videos before sending across the bb 103 whatsapp cannotdoes not this might be a showstopper for some for others here i would give the competition the advantage though caveat it that you dont have a single point of integration as the hub snowball for android is trying to do the same and no notifications do not count in the integrated hub  typing  i am pretty fast on the virtual keyboards yet i must say typing on the passport is pure joy for all you road warriors its like typing on an ibm thinkpad after one of those ultraportable laptops you appreciate the key travel and the tactile feel of the keys   app notifications  here both the m8 and the iphone 6 are far ahead and i am not sure whether bb10xx will catch up anytime soon  apps  this the 800 pound gorilla in the room spoiler alert ios8 wins hands down the passports implementation of android 443 is not ready for the big time yet i have had some lag performance and crashes and random errors including qnxlauncher is not something or the other do you want to shut it down i will give a list of apps that i use that work on the device but all in all it is a step in the right direction but a long way to go stillso the progression from ios to bb 103 is a follows 80 of apps i use on ios are there on android 70 of those that are on android work on bb 103 so from ios to bb 103 your app universe shrinks by 4045 is it bad not really  is it ideal not really apps that i use and work are as follows not exhaustive but what i use asalesforce classic better than the native connect to salesforce b engadget cflipboarda bit troublesome sometimes but generally works d soundhound again better than native e spotify  yes works great fguardianwsj again a hit or miss and crashes or freezes often g swarm not foursquarezomato h pininterest iroku jgoalcom ktodoist lmoneycontrolbloombergftettoiagain better than native m connect for garmin syncs my vivofit whitings training peaks n luminositysome scaling issues duolingo  apps that i have not been able to get to work a onenote bviber c zygna poker asphalt 7 d bubble ds  bb assistant  this is slow but i will say awesome even better that siri but slower  one example will highlight this i fee like eating a kebab the assistant will take some time but come back with a list of food places with kebab in them where as siri says sorry i cant look for restaurants in india common  maps  not as straight forward as google but not bad and i have side loaded google maps no google play support so it wont remember your searches otherwise works quite well  but nokia here maps did not work when side loaded  battery  i am not so sure yet on this as i do need to currently charge it every day and that could be because i am trying a lot on it everyday so i will reserve comment on it other than it is better than an m8  screen  here i feel the m8 might be the best but i love the form factor and clarity and brightness of the screen even at 50 brightness  4g or lte  this is another reason my review gave it a notch down as i am not happy that the passport does not support the 2300mhz band in india also i have forced 3g selection but it is  for the new antenna tech and jargon as good as either my m8 or iphone 6 maybe a software update will sort this out  looks  honestly people find the phone strange and i introduce it as the blackberry tv and some people even believe it i dont care  so all in all i give it a 4 stars because it is my goto phone for work and some play but i carry an iphone 6 around in the evenings this is neither practical or feasible for everyone so make your own decisions but for me the passport is here to stay
2562	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	the first thing you notice is that this isnt your usual rectangular shaped screen its a square display measured at 45 which is bigg   the large display offers an uncompromising experience for viewing content reading  editing word  excel documents using maps managing email and browsing the web   the display is an ips lcd screen with super high resolutions of 1440 x 1440 pixels on screen and a pixel density of 454ppi that beats even the new iphone 6 or your nexus5 it also has corning gorilla glass 3 protection to secure that beautiful display  besides that the passport packs a 13mp rear camera with optical image stabilization  a 2mp front cam also a 226 ghz quadcore snapdragon 801 processor customized for blackberry  along with that 32gb builtin memory 3gb ram  a 3450 mah battery this trio is a killer the battery of this phone is tested to last a good 36hrs of proper usage 3g social networking gaming multitasking etc and has a standby time of about 18 days  4 quality speakers make the passport 350 more crisp  more louder that the galaxy s5  the most innovative feature and probably the most important and the usp of this device is the keypad now its not a normal keypad the keys a capactive that allows the entire keypad to double up as a trackpad for example if you want to scroll updown while reading or surfing the internet you can simply scroll on the physical keypad to move around your screen also while typing a sentence if you want to delete an entire word you simply swipe from right to left on your keyboard and one word gets deleted per swipe now that is something new and innovative  the software blackberry 103 is not your old bb software its a brand new software and super productive things like the blackberry hub which manages all your msgs and notifications in one place helps manage your chores all in one go interactive active frames displaying all open apps video callingpicture password 2 different appstores because it has alll the apps that you need the amazon app store for android apps is built into the blackberry passport which carries 3 lac android apps that work on blackberry 103 you can even sideload 98 of all android apps on the passport  all in all its a device completely one of its kind its unique ppl can make blackberry the butt of all jokes all they like but you cant deny that the innovation blackberry came up with could not have been expected from companies whos latest innovations were a larger screen for the first time or something as silly as a heart rate monitor  go for this one its hip to be square  its better to have a tool of productivity than a toy for gaming     
2563	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	the best mobile in the market for handling large email traffic battery life is excellent and so is the screen sharpness you have to get used to the size but it makes reading enjoyable as usual case and screen guard for this mobile are not available blackberry never bothers to look at this level of customer needs excellent voice clarity
2564	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	i have used samsung s4 then iphone 5s but the passport has far more better features i am loving it the size is good is not odd as said by some the feel is nice  the os is extremely well drafted
2565	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	i just love the big screen the humongous battery life and the amazing and magical physical  keyboard  which is sensitive to touch add to that the speed of the device and the 103 os not to forget the blackberry blend feature takes a couple of days to get used to the device because of the new keyboard and the size but once you do it is a serious productivity beast those who use their phones for gaming may not like it as much
2566	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	i am definitely delighted with this device it has everything that a android device has and still has a physical keyboard super camera email settings in a ziffy bright display and great sound output makes this device an absolute winner
2567	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	i used an android for around 3 years then i switched to lumia for 2 years i got really bored of that same os again and again  then i switched to this the blackberry passport  it is no doubt an amazing phone  its got amazing coool features  processing is unbelievable  got a better battery life compared to others  the swipe keyboard is responsive and works fine  camera is equal as to any other phone with a 13mp no less no more  speakers are osum they are tool loud and clear a 10 on 10 for the speakers  got 2 app stores blackberry world and amazon app store ull find each and every app on it but few of them cannot work on blackberry os  the keyboard pattern will take a little time to adjust but when u get it itll be fun  its got a setting for each and every thing a blackberry os has never dissapointed me and trust me this one will is their best  it has got some apps of its own not available on android not soo great but yaa its yours if u have a blackberry  the big screen is just beautiful ull fall in love with it  built is strong and attractive it is not that difficult to carry  pros  when u play a video at full screen since its a square screen u can view it only in the half of the screen  1 app that i really need and didnt work was bookmyshow  camera of my nokia lumia 920 was amazing the pure view of lumias is unbeatable miss that  out of 32gb given to the phone 10gb is taken by the os itself but yaa it gives u an option of the mem card  bottom line this phone gives all the features and functions given by any other phone but with its own way i believe a person looking for some change something new to use and bored of other os must go for it i didnt find it something to be priced at 50k they could have given a 4045k but then again the same thing goes for iphone 6 dont buy it if ure a full on app maniac buy it if you look for basic apps  some new and impressive operating system and there is nothing like its only for business going boys its a complete package if ure a music lover or a whatsapp guy or facebook girl or calling up is ur taste u can go for it not an issue i am having great fun using it i guess i am the only one with this in my college p and yes ofcourse the first look on peoples face when they see that phone in ur hand youll get that attention go for it
2568	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	technology as its said is best  hands of blackberry such a super phone is made with ease of type and scroll unless a iphone user or samsung user tries his hands out he wont know what is real technology they are used to playing candy crush  subway surfer  with 103 the blackberry os has got a leap ahead of competition blend the most interactive way to connect mobile to laptoppctablet  camera has improved nearly 100  from predecessor z30 battery life is good for entire 1  2 days on medium to heavy usage pattern typing and surfing was never so ease earlier  knowing the form factor let me explain to entire apple and samsung ducks this is a blackberry and not a no sense device which you guys are using praise the best or lay to rest  emails bbm chats with stickers bbm channels presentation utliity apps nfc bbm meetings file sharing usb otg miracast wifi direct superfast processor a mammoth battery great camera backlit keyboard keyboard scrolling blackberry blend one of worlds most advance way to connect mobile via desktop  laptop  tablet   be smart buy blackberry 
2569	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	every moment with the phone makes me fall in love with it even more the whole idea of the work wide aspect is awesome the keyboard is simply the best thing for typing and social buds out there as well as perfect for the people who work and write a lot of emails and also read and edit excel sheets the entertainment is also pretty awesome the speakers are the most loud and absolutely crisp and clear the screen quality is gorgeous the camera performs the best a blackberry phone before and is also at par or at times better than other flagship phones am simply loving it and its worth every penny ive paid definitely reccomend
2570	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	i have used both android and ios and briefly a blackberry many years ago my last phone was a moto g which was terrific and before that i owned an iphone 5 i can say without doubt this is by far my favourite phone it is superb as a phone its battery easily lasts me a full working day with juice to spare the browser is great and snappy i love the inbuilt fm radio and the hub i find the illuminated keyboard invaluable for working on the go at night im starting to use the blackberry travel app bbm for free text and calls is a hit i have a rs 5000 gift voucher from amazon from the purchase and will shortly get my free jp miles as well  the apps stores as other reviewers have noted do have gaps but not enough to cause me any problems and i did not buy this to play games on i have access to blackberry world and the amazon app store i discovered how to side load snap which gives me access to the google app store as well the keyboard is fantastic and i am zipping through emails and such in the hub i would fully recommend the phone thanks to all who answered questions i asked on amazon before i purchased it helped in making the change
2571	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	many great things can be said about the phone but the one that stands out for me is battery an astounding 3450mah that will give any super heavy user a smooth sail through the day without worrying there are androids except z3 and huawei ascend mate 7 and iphones which have the best of almost everything but lack on the battery part the passport sums everything up as needed enough said
2572	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	passport is in my hand from last few days and i am extremely happy with this product i dont need tablet to read books i like its keyboard to scroll screen updown video and audio quality is superb excellent look with metal strip which adds value to its look short of apps many be point for few but i am ok as major apps are already there like evernote
2573	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	big awkward very productive massive battery unique eye catching excellent for seeing spreadsheets  these are the few thoughts i have about the new blackberry  passport  when i opened the box i thought my god how am i going to carry this thing though i had taken out my tape measure to see how big it would be on reading the specs i was still shocked on actually seeing it  slowly as i started using it i got used to this mammoth phone setting up this mobile was a breeze  the key board though is different from the blackberry curve i am used to a new learning curve here  but a week on i am loving it this phone slips easily in the upper shirt pocket though its made for ceos wearing a suit it can be easily carried and i believe that this should not deter us in using this new form factor  its a pleasure in using this mobile to see spreadsheets you can really work wide with the blackberry passport seeing ppt is also a pleasure as it has a 3gb ram big excel sheets can be opened in a jiffy   using blackberry for mails and sms was always excellent and the same holds true for blackberry passport also  the concept is hub is unique and all those using their mobile for business purposes will find this concept fantastic  as usual the notification led light is the highlight of blackberry  the massive internal memory of 32gb with the option of inserting 128 gb micro sd is the big plus point for storage for those on the go  as mentioned by all in many reviews you will have to use both the hands one hand will not do though some of the operations are possible with a little practice using this new keyboard requires a bit of practice but you will love it once you get used to it  this mobile is also useful for those having telecons  frequently you can dial and minimise the dial up interface you can at the same time open up spreadsheets ppts etc and keep participating in the conference with earphones connected everything can be easily minimised and accessed on the screen  the voice clarity is excellent you will find it a bit difficult in holding this phone initially while speaking but will get used to it  some dos and donts  when speaking you will have to hold the phone in such a way that the small speaker is exactly touching the ears if not placed properly since its a large phone the voice clarity may not be good but if placed properly then the clarity is excellent  you have to download wps office or office suit pro as the pre installed docs to go does not have the filter options for excel sheets hope microsoft offers the ms office free for blackberry also as they are for android and ios now  do not sync the hotmail address book this creates multiple duplicate entries and the address book slows down massively appears to be a hotmail error i had to manually delete the entire address book and transfer the address book from my blackberry curve using the bluetooth after doing this the problem got resolved  security remains a largely compromised area with many mobiles in todays world we are prone to using mobile devices for online shopping and banking services credit cards are used how can we then ignore the security offered by blackberry all the more the most ignored aspect is built strongly in blackberry devices  what the os 10 misses out is the facility to forward sms as mail or mail as sms which is available in older os  for seeing the images in mail you have to click a small arrow at the right side of the page a bit irritating maybe there is a way out  blackberry passport has otg facility a feature less written about an excellent phone for those on the move and also those who use their phones for mails  sms  this device is not for playing junk games like candy crush or subway surfer   the massive battery lasts for 15 to 2 days on average use for me only 70 gets used each day on average to heavy use  i have penned this entire review on my blackberry passport  its not a smartphone its a genius phone
2574	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	hub is the core and more powerful feature of blackberry for people using phone for business efficiency generated by this phone is supreme this is the primary reason for me to try this phone when i already have iphone 5s and android phone this is a good enough reason to ignore limitations of app developers community and apps pool available for blackberry phone is terrifically fast and sound is awesome battery is also much better than iphones of this world truly a productivity tool yes screen gives a very different and amazing readability especially for apps like twitter and facebook and likes emails can be well read in one screen  negatives little heavy for what i would have liked phone size odd so hits peoples perceptions directly on the other hand does generate productivity
2575	BlackBerry Passport (Black)	everybody needs a change fashion repeats so square phones are back blackberry passport for serious work and style you will have to get used to this that will take atleast one day and you will love it  great pictures in action  httpwwwbbinin201410blackberrypassportreview

2581	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	i had ordered xperia z2 if i understand correct it has come from india only hence it shouldve had a indian charger however it has us charger and moreover the seal of box seems to be a duplicate which has been pasted with sony round sticker with a cellophane tape may i know how to return it this is ridiculous the cover in which the mobile doesnt seem to be genuine as well this is a secondhand phone
2582	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	it is one of the best mobiles in the market today in terms of capabilities quality and utility camera gives absolutely stunning pictures and panorama feature is exceptionally great only suggestion i have is that sony must add stylus with the phone i am having to use a hairpin as make do stylus  if this phone falls in budget then must go for it
2583	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	when sony xperia z1 released i was one of the first customers to buy the handset from flipkart with lot of excitementbut trust me i am experiencing pathetic customer service from the customer care and service center department  sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products but in my case i failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like xperia z18230  1 on 24th december when i woke up in the morning i saw my xperia z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet there was no damage on the external glass but however the display had cracked from inside a single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked8230  2 in my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18000 rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on its own from inside there is no sign of external damage on the screen  3 sony customer care executives and sony service center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances they are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status i had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the sony service center i know few acquaintances who had similar experience with service center bhubaneswar  4 my handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me i requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked if i can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why cant the technicians employed by sony do the same  arent they qualified enough  5 while i handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when i received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly i have the photographs available with me  6 i had heard that sony xperia z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me  7 after sending an email to sony senior management in india sony head office support team sent an email stating i have to pay 50 of mrp for refurbished handset without accessories and 80 of mrp rs 28500 for fresh handset without accessories8230 prices offered by local sony service center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price8230 whatever happens to your handset sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k 30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment8230  it8217s really frustrating as sony customer service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty designbad quality equipment being used  trust me guys the service being offered by samsung for galaxy s4 which is a comparable model with z1 is much better than sony8230 sony is having the worst after sales service8230 i would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free82308230
2584	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	its been only one month and one day i kept it inside drawerstable and steady positionedone hour later i find back panel having multiple cracks on it one day later i observed cpu temperature rise upto 57 degree celsius probably because of temperature the cracks happened i talked to the customer care but they didnt consider any liability for such damage though its not an accidental damage its not covered under warranty because of internal heat ie manufacturing defect it happened but its not covered under warranty even if i get the back panel replaced what is the garranty that it will not crack again because of overheating
2585	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	what i ordered sony z2 with digital noise cancelling headset smart band swr10 premium case cover i was excited as its my first time and also really happy while ordering things and finally after 2 days when i open the pack got surprised the box came with just a phone and charger with third class headset amazon people sucks now this people saying me to do fresh order mlm i already lost some good deals and i have to wait 78 to get my money back got only knows ill get it or not
2586	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	the product was not as described it does not contain sony smart band  premium leather case
2587	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	after ysing iphone for long i was reluctant tomove to android i baught moto g first to give it a try and then played safe with this product this is a gem from sony a lot customizable and excellent multimedia features camera amd a plethora of supporting in house apps music is awsome beats ipod size is perfect and ui is awsone best in android i would say
2588	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	i have bought this phone from local sony store near my house in mumbai actually we bought 3 phones on a same day one for myself xperia z2 one for my sister galaxy s5 and one for my elder brother note 3 ps  i used to own samsung note 2 before buying this  so basically i am going to compare these three devices  display  display on note 3 or s5 is absolutely magnificent but having said that the wider range of colors that z2s display produces is far beyond the capabilities of any other phone in the market right now closest rival might be xperia z ultra note 3 and s5  z2 wins the battle here i could not believe the color reproduction that z2 is able to deliver amazing  built quality  looks  again absolutely no contest here z2 wins it hands down the built quality and the looks on this device is incomparable to plasticee samsung or lgs  note 3 is second and s5 distant third back panel of s5 is ugly  sound  z2 wins speaker are loder and clearer to both note 3 and s5 if you want better speaker go for htc one which is better than any other phone in the market  speed  again theres not a lot of difference there but indian version of both note 3 and s5 uses samsungs own cheapset pun intended where as sony uses powerful snapdragon theres not a lot of difference but snapdragon handles everything better  camera  many people complaining and claiming themselves to be professional photographers are either stupid or simply doesnt own this phone all the phones captures great images  calling  here note 3 wins sound of calls on note 3 and even s5 is superior to z2 not only that but while talking to someone on this phone the voice of the person from the other end can be heard by people around you i dont know why but for 50k phone this is a huge let down  games  again equally good on all of them  music  walkman provided by sony is better than any music player z2 wins  interface  both note 3 and s5 lags a bit due to sluggish touchwiz even i had same problem with note 2 sonys interface is cleaner and premium though it all come to personal preference and may be i got bugged to touchwiz after using back to back samsung devices one thing i hate about sony is on screen home menu and  back button  handling  all of them are quite comfortable to handle but z2 feels premium while note 3 feels more comfortable even though it has the biggest display of the 3  final verdict  to be very honest both my brother and sister and jealous of my phone and they admitted that my z2 is better than their phones so go for it if you have no problem with the price and you dont mind cleaning fingerprint marks on your phone after frequent intervals
2589	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	the phone arrived in good condition  box  accessories but functioning has been doubtful at times it works fine many times  it acts weird  lags  autouses touchscreen sometimes 1 sometimes the touchscreen changes the reaction to extreme unwanted functions eg  i am pressing lowest end of screen  it opens options as if i touch right top of screen next second it auto types words with letters i m not touching or sometimes not even wanting to type so sometimes it also ends up deleting stuff i want i have to restart the phone  then usually this stops  the phone works barely normal again its unpredictable 2 the phone network just doesnt respond well many times for few days i thought this might be my network issue but then i have a year old tablet with same network which works fine at the same locations or times sometimes the z2 just doesnt connect well to 3g  switches alternatively to 2g at random moments usually when 3g is urgently needed  sometimes the network just goes blank completely no 3g no 2g no network at all considering that i ve paid to get the best mobile in the market i feel i have got a soso mobile which only works perfect most times  acts weird the few times i need it to work well quite a smart phone has mood swings i guess  though i dont know if its sony or amazon to answer i dont really think sony has ever had such weird issues i ve always been a sony user  this is not the first z series in my household  i think i might stay off amazon  this seller coz my usual trusted flpkrt has never yielded me such problems in years
2590	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	fantastic phone nothing can beat xperia flagship been using for 6 months got lollipop update as well
2591	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	now it has been quite sometime that i have bought this phone from amazon since i was terribly disappointed with my previous sony phone xperia x10  first 4 inch android phone in the market bought it at launch this time i lowered down my expectations a lot and did a lot of research on the product before buying it but alas i guess now reviews are also not to be trusted no doubt what they said was right  but what they hid was crucial so all the gimmicks about it are pretty useless  1 looks  certainly killer looks that is when it is on the table and with the cover the cover acts as cleaner by regular wiping off the smudges from the glossy screen i tried using it without the cover and within a hour it looked like as if i picked it up from a dustbin no exaggerations here just forget using it without cover 2 speaking of cover the cover is pretty nice the only problem is it is awkward to put in the charger with the cover on the position of charging port is on the inside edge of the phonemeans you have to keep it open while charging pretty ugly huh 3 also cover makes it next to impossible one had operation which i prefer i am 61 feet tall with fairly large hands than most ppl with lesser height i didnt thought it will be a problem well it is the screen size make it a bit difficult thought it is manageable without cover 4 great part  the screen awesomebrilliant mind blowingsuperb a treat in itself if you are watching videos or even movies on the go but then 52 inch screen is too small a tablet would be better 5 speakers  for a phone call very good speakersmic not external ones but when listening to musicvedios or phone calls in speaker mode almost inaudible voice unless there is a pin drop silence earphones provided along are useless quality you will feel ashamed using the in public with this phone i couldnt use my regular headphones with the phone it is not supported i tried three different headsets guess sony still wants me to spend another 10000 bucks on headphones 6 camera  i dont know what i should say about it i am a photography enthusiast and usually take shots from my canon 7d dslr which is irreplaceable but very heavy to carry around all the time the sole reason i bought this phone was the reviews i got for the camera i was disappointed would be an understatement it is certainly a good camera when you compare with micromax or lava but then those are not 50000 rs phones here are the reasons     average quality pics in auto mode every nokia phone i used had a better quality    low quality night shots    much touted time shift videos or other photographic effect are useless as they are just software apps you can do better on you laptop and practically you can not edit your pics on phone and video editing is close to impossible if you are any serious about it time shift mode doesnt take more frames per second but only allows you to delete certain frames to create illusions     4k camcorder   seriously i wont comment on this overall  camera feature are nice for a expensive toy but if you are any serious about photography  take your pocket camera with you this isnt a replacement now biggest issue with the camera  this phone is a powerhouse phone with hardware on steroidssuper fast processing but then that is the problem it generates heat lots of it a few minutes of temple run increases the back side temperature in high forties it is well known that camera sensors are very sensitive to heat thats why on every camera manual it is written not to leave it in direct sunlight for extended period this is the biggest issue with the phone it is fast but if i use it for gaming i will burn off the sensor if i dont what is the use of 3 gb ram and a super fast processor with high end graphics  7 the smart band given with it is pretty useless used it for two weeks then realized that captured data is useless the only good thing about it is it vibrates if you leave you phone and walk away almost 5 meters saves your phone from getting lost vibrates for incoming calls good when phone is in back pack otherwise its a hassle  8waterproofing features   didnt dare to try  overall verdict  the phone isnt a bad phone but set your expectation right if you think that by spending 50 k you will get a music player camera video player phone and a gaming device in one body then you are right but none of these functions will be good for practical use other than occasional times when you want to click that selfie it is just like an expensive toy for fun  nothing serious also all other high end features like screen mirroring wifi direct nfc etc will require you to buy more gadgets to be able to use them  mostly from sony itself so unless you are going to spend close to 2 lacs on all these devices these features are pretty much useless for you then why bother about these better buy a 20 k phone with decent features than a 50 k phone with top end features   but then i do it all the timecoz i like to show off my latest gadget only for the sake of it 
2592	Sony Xperia Z2 (Black)	the phone is excellent as such i just wish they gave the noise cancellation ear phones and magnetic dock like they do in other countries instead of this useless smart band the flip case is good quality no doubt but i prefer normal cases  wouldve had 5 stars if not for the unless smart band

2618	Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Space Grey, 16GB)	pros 1 the size the extra screen realestate makes using apps that are optimized for the 6 great a lot of content can be seen 2 the iphone already has a camera that cant be matched by any other phones the 6 also optical image stabilization which the 6 doesnt that provides for less shakier shots in the dark 3 the battery life is amazing its nearly double what the 6 has it is impossible to kill this thing in a day 4 rounded edges make swiping from the edges and holding the phone a great experience 5 the build quality  cons 1 some apps about 25 arent optimized for the 6 those apps look extremely weird on the big screen 2 because of the 6 being so large and having rounded corners and a metallic body one always gets the feeling that it can be dropped from the hand anytime 3 as with any other apple product price

2623	Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Space Grey, 16GB)	two things  1 i got 6 plus it is a good phone but now that i have it i feel like i should have waited for samsung s6 cuz camera quality between these 2 phones is certainly noticeable  2 i have an yellow tint on my screen not sure if u can see it in these pics but its there
2624	Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Space Grey, 16GB)	im an android user shifting to apple i used a transparent rinkefusion case and tempered glass screen protector that i ordered from amazon which came same time as the case was delivered pros as always amazon delivery is awesome xd even though the site said it would take 6 days for me to get it i got it within 3 daysxd  bangalorekollamkerala amazing phone  comes in proper apple wrapping  amazon packaging over it  even though the camera is 13mp spec wise the real life feel is that of a 18 or 21mp camera time lapse is also an amazing new feature  xd  cons hmmm thinking hard unable to find any cons with it xd ah took a while for me to unlock and find the hotspot feature and when u switch on the phone for the first time the phone will refuse to unlock without a sim so be sure to have your nano sim card ready when u inbox this beast xd
2625	Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Space Grey, 16GB)	this is an excellent phone lives up to the expectation
2626	Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Space Grey, 16GB)	the best in the worldno bending problemnothingjust a master piecesurely u love it when you get it into your hands
2627	Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Space Grey, 16GB)	a great smartphone from apple not the greatest as there are a number of smartphones today with similar and number of other interesting features for demanding users having said that this phone ticks most of the right boxes if not all the screen is not only bigger but much better at 400 ppi and very natural colours daytime readability is excellent the camera is simply superbalthough not in the same class as my lumia 1020 still very good detail wise and more natural colours usability is excellent response time super fast very few smartphone cameras in the market can match the performance videos are very pleasant with ois and slow motion is an excellent feature to have battery life is very reliable  at 2915 mah it may not be the highest spec wise but performance wise it can match any phone in the market even with reasonably heavy useitll easilylast the daymoderate users will find the juice enough for 2 days absence of a few features like wireless charging additional memory slotsare annoyingbutthats the way apple goes the real cons for me is its big size and slippery feelbeing ridiculously thin doesnt help with the grip andalthoughnot wanting im ending up using a case for better grip user interface provides few useful features to make its singlehanded use possible in most situations despite its big size and i find adapting to its big dimensions rather easy
2628	Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Space Grey, 16GB)	amazon one day shipping is amazing and the phone was officially sealed as described 
2629	Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Space Grey, 16GB)	this phone is ok but has bending problems paying a large amount and buying this phone is waste because we can experience this same quality in other phones but the pics are very clear

2631	Apple iPhone 6 Plus (Space Grey, 16GB)	thought i had got what i had expected but actually its a lot more apple continues to amaze with the features it has provided that keep learning as you use the phone eg going to frequently used alternate keyboard instead of going thru sequence of all alternate keyboards word suggestions as you type etc thanks to amazon for being reliable as always and cloudtail seller for such competitive prices lucky got this one for less

2640	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (Blue)	otg cable not supporting my device very bad camera 13 mp but picture not clear veiw sony 5mp is good quality not worth the price
2641	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (Blue)	hi i had purchased micromax nitro a310 in october 2014 it is a pathetic phone display went off in just 6 months i had to buy another phone because service centres said that they have to keep the phone for 10 days what will do without phone for ten days i bought samsung on the spot  s3 neo please dont trust micromax guys after spending 11800 for nitro a310 i had to spend 13500 for samsung phone it is a request to all the buyers not to buy any micromax phones because it gets too hot and also quality of product and services are very bad they dont even update their service centres if they change i had to search hard for the service centre in andheri they had mentioned on the net the address which is not existing their phone numbers are also not working
2642	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (Blue)	poor camera and unpolished user interface makes this device not for recommended on paper its shows lots of strength but in real world struggles a lot 2 gb of ram is useless when operating system is not smooth 13 mp camera produce too much noise and struggle to focus
2643	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (Blue)	notably the only difference between the canvas nitro a310 and canvas nitro a311 is that the latter includes 16gb of inbuilt storage other specifications of the new smartphone are identical to the original canvas nitro a310  look and feel our instant reaction on holding the micromax canvas nitro with its weight of 146g was that it felt heavier than the other options in this price range the rear of the micromax canvas nitro looks quite similar to that of the samsung galaxy note 3 with its faux stitchedleather finish the front is mostly uninspiring with the 5inch screen taking up most of the real estate in fact the phone on the whole looks rather tepid and does nothing to capture attention  specifications and software micromax has fitted the canvas nitro with the octacore mediatek mt6592 processor which is clocked at 17ghz and has an integrated mali450 gpu the canvas nitro also features 2gb of ram out of the 8gb of internal storage space only 568gb is available for users but you can expand this by up to 32gb using a microsd card  the phone accepts two microsim cards and they connect to the 850 900 1800 1900 2100 network bands it can also connect to wifi networks and other bluetoothenabled devices a 2500mah battery provides the juice for the device the 5inch 720p display is great for the most part with vibrant colours and good viewing angles but things go downhill when viewed under direct sunlight the screen is very reflective and we had a difficult time trying to use this phone because of this  micromax has tweaked the software to add a few additional features which have been mostly borrowed from samsungs touchwiz and htcs sense ui for starters micromax adds a quicklook page to the left of the primary homescreen quicklook is nothing but micromaxs attempt to emulate htcs blinkfeed which itself is based on flipboard one more swipe from the quicklook page shows the settings where one can choose which topics the feed displays one can also add facebook and twitter accounts so that they can reflect in the feed however there is no way to add feeds from specific websites moreover there is a weird blue tint to the background of text when any article is opened making it rather difficult to read  the lockscreen has a simple swipeup gesture and available notifications are displayed on a red band some of the other software tweaks include the ability to pause video playback when the user looks away which is a direct lift of samsungs smart pause feature it works most of the time if ambient lighting is good enough  camera the 13megapixel camera on the micromax canvas nitro is the perfect example of why the megapixel count doesnt matter the lens and sensor of this phone clearly dont do it any justice as a result when seen at actual size it is quite evident that captured photos lack a lot of details if viewed closely one can observe a blue tint to photographs which means that the white balance is off in low light the camera failed to capture any detail whatsoever the only upside is that the camera can focus and shoot images really fast  captured video is recorded in 3gpp format for some reason and the quality is really bad the camera couldnt stay focused on any subject and video was just very dim surprisingly the fixedfocus 5megapixel front camera can capture decent images but it is not as good as the one on the sony xperia c3 dual  micromax has added a camera widget to one of the home screens which directly lets a user access some of the cameras many modes the selfie mode is selfexplanatory frontback mode takes pictures with both cameras and shows them in splits creen we fail to understand the novelty of this mode and think that micromax could have stuck to the triedandtested pictureinpicture format used by other smartphone companies there is a stable mode in which a reading like a heart rate monitor moves on top of the screen to show you when the device is stable enough for shooting the camera app by itself provides a lot of cool options like saying the word cheese to capture an image which didnt work most of the time also there are a few manual controls as well but hiding oftenused modes like hdr deep in the settings menu is rather annoying  performance we didnt face any hiccups while using the micromax canvas nitro every day it has smooth transitions and works quite well it is a great smartphone experience we even tried highend games like asphalt 8 and dead trigger 2 and we didnt face any lag whatsoever  the canvas nitro played all the heavily encoded videos we threw at it without any hassles the loudspeaker is not too loud and moreover it distorts at high volumes the bundled earphones will serve the purpose for most people which is a good thing the call quality is really good and the sound on both ends of the call was crystal clear  we were completely floored at the battery performance of the canvas nitro it managed to play video in a loop for 16 hours and 9 minutes before it died on us this is exceptional battery life and this one performance stat alone is enough to sway a lot of buyers in the favour of this phone
2644	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (Blue)	the phone is worth every penny for the price the camera the processor the storage is really good even the ui is very good but the battery is pathetic it lasted under 10 hours on a full charge and remember it is for a new phone so if you are a heavy user then this phone is not for you but otherwise the phone is worth looking into
2645	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (Blue)	i m using a310 more than 7 months no complaint so far  battery lasts 2 days for normal use  camera back and front are good no complain back camera low light photos are good even better with night mode on and flash off  gaming multitasking  touch 3g n 2g speed wifi all vgoog  sturdy  idropped it aprox four to five times in 7 months  still no problems yet  do few things  disable inbuilt apps you dont use and install noroot firewall by grey shirts to control net access of any app and your mobile will be rocking  earlier used nokia samsung even blackberry but surprised with canvas nitro  vgood cant give less than 5 star

2661	HTC Desire 816G+ Octa-core (Dual SIM, 16GB, Blue)	after searching on google reading lots of reviews for almost 30 days i bought this phone here because of the selling price well delivery was good but packaging was really bad because htc box was in a pouch only now about this phone this phone comes with octa core processor amazing looks no lag phone good camera and touch is cream sound is amazing battery last for almost two days after charging fully  well if you think this device has some serious heating issues then you are absolutely wrong even i phone6 get heats up very quickly  personal experience   this phone is very good quality phone htc brand is enough  you may get too much specification in other cheap chinese brands now its up to you quality over quantity   go for it amazing stuff

2678	Xolo Win Q1000 (White)	hi i suresh i am recently purchased xolo win q 1000  i was really told this phone was awesome to the futures and game experience  i am fully flat on this graphics looking awesome  i was thinking to this window mobile there is no apps  and not support some apps but finally i was change my mind after using this phone  because here we have a windows store and there is lot of useful  apps available but small mistake is mobile camera dont have zoom option  that is only mistake otherwise this phone was overall good to cost of windows phone and  phone display looking cristal  clean picture
2679	Xolo Win Q1000 (White)	third grade product will not function properly xolo customer care also does not any support in fact the customer care is very in efficient and clogged with all the customer complaints of xolo products  never buy a xolo product
2680	Xolo Win Q1000 (White)	fantastic
2681	Xolo Win Q1000 (White)	good
2682	Xolo Win Q1000 (White)	all the function are good but the major is quality of back cameraits so bad and i am not feeling well to take a selfisecond problem is that of sound speakeri am not alsoeveryone dont like these type of sound quality
2683	Xolo Win Q1000 (White)	bed quality phone 
2684	Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo (Marble White)	no otg support and no nfc in this mobile otherwise gud phone charge backup and games support is very nice
2685	Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo (Marble White)	good phone
2686	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	i think samsung is desperately trying to compete with low priced phones if so then  this will definitely fail at this price one can get many other brand phones with far superior specifications why offer tizen when android platform is free samsung and others should realise that a sizeable customers dont care for brands anymore but will try a high spec phone available at throw away prices micromax spark lenovo a6000 etc etc offers are simply irresistible
2687	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	samsung promoting their tizen os by this phone tizen looks like a developed version of samsungs bada os with some new so called smart features and a new ui for apps and games we have to visit tizen store which is preinstalled in this device most of good apps and games are pay n use most of the free apps are almost useless internal storage is 4gb from which 2gb occupies by system  pros  i screen  touch touch is great there is lack of sensor so no option for auto brightness screen resolution is good  ii sound sound is good  iii tizen store some useful apps are available on store  iv camera 31mp camera is good front camera is also nice  v smooth ui ui is smoothbut smoothness is not everything  vi some apps are movable on sd card  cons  itizen store tizen store is a place of wastes i cant find any descent photo editing app there only whatsapp available hike  we chat and other messengers are missing not even that we can not use whatsapp without installing an another app called acl this acl occupies almost 155mb on internal storage  ii hanging problem hangs while playing game or some high resolution videos  iii back cover back cover attracts dust easily  iv mp3 player although sound is good but there is lack of equalizer  v gps gps is too slowor useless to use i cannot find my location after waiting for 15 minutes  vi ultra power saving mode this is the main attraction of this device ultra power saving mode is nothing but a marketing gimmick cause by enabling this we can not explore all features this app saves power with a simple ui and giving permission to access limited apps in any phone we can save power by this process no one needs a app for that  verdict if you are former android user dont ever think to buy this
2688	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	performance of this phone is really good though the camera is a 3mp still picture looks like from a 5mp only disadvantage is that the number of available apps is in the store i am expecting that people start contributing towards the tizen apps to create huge repository satisfied with the phone at this price range
2689	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	i bought this mobile phone for my momand she is not so familiar witth these android touch phonesbut when she use this mobile she feel very comfortable
2690	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	i expected that there will be google play store but it is not available some apps are not being found to download and use
2691	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	i couldnt understand the pricing when i was searching i found the rate as 7500 and a savings of around 1900 but on the box it is mentioned as 5990 which is correct and whether this is the same mobile order or anything else though it working well and it comes with tizen os which is also confusing whether this is a android or something else
2692	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	had initial problems with watsapp but works fine now with new watsapp messanger speed is really fast given the specs a good buy for 5k as quality hardware and fast user interface dont get worried after seeing specsphone is way ahead according to specs i cant play asphalt 8 on my 12 gb ram micromax properly but on this with 756 mb ram it runs without any lagsor hangs and crashes eververy smoothand mind you its a 2gb game good battery life only one problem is that not all android apps are there in tizen storebut increasing every day overall quality hardware and speed at this price
2693	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	i have gifted this phone to my wifeand she loves this phone very muchthanks for samsung who provides such features in such a low price
2694	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	i need original receipt for samsung z1 which i purchased on 19th may 2015 can u send by email address  ajaymahadik1999gmailcom
2695	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	apps are terrible and there arent enough of them for basic phone use it might be ok the os is surprisingly fast compared to android
2696	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	not at all good samsung should never sell this product at a price level of above 5000
2697	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	interface is fresh and smoothwhatsapp working greatneed more applications
2698	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	it is my third phone from samsung after trend and star pro both the phones failed to provide a smooth android experience but this phone does not run android but a tenson os  coming to pros the phone have 1a 768 mb of ram good for tenson 2 a 3g network 3 a stylish and sleek look a certain no of cons r there as well 1 less no of apps 2 bad front camera 3 less amount of space approx 3gb 4 sound not that loud but this is a good phone and must buy option for people looking for phones under 6k
2699	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	awesome phonewith amazing battery life security and camera
2700	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	this phone runs tizenwhy does samsung expect indians to buy this instead of redmi note 2
2701	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	very good phone in lower segment and excellent features worth for money  i am 100 satisfied with it
2702	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	there is no android phone bad phone
2703	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	lookwise good picture clarity good
2704	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	dint much like it too slow
2705	Samsung Z1 SM-Z130H (Black)	brought this phone from a local phone my advice do not by this because 1tizen app store is very limited no popular games or apps 2poor whattsapp experience app crashes while pressing the send button 3 samsung has so many apps in android like s voice but no such apps in tizen so the arent supporting tizen 4 location icon always blinking poor gps chip draining the bettery forced to switch off the location setting 5 contact problem with the charger and phone 6 battery indicator is shown in grey and white so very difficult to determine the capacity unless you include battery capacity in percentage 7 while charging also it very difficult to determine whether charging or not white battery with a invisible grey z mark on it note android changes the battery colour to green while charging and charging shows in notification led also tizen is a half baked product and samsung is experimenting with our money
2706	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	i have been using this phone for over two months now to start at around 16k this is an awesome phone some of its features are absolutely top drawer when compared to other phones in this price range 1 the cameras both front and back are brilliant some very clever features have been added to the stock camera app which eliminates the need of installing any other camera app there is a gesture recognition feature for the front camera which makes it a real joy to use and gives clear steady and shakefree selfies as you dont need to tap or click anywhere on the phone to take the pic it also has a facetweeking feature which i found real fun to use as far as the basic parameters are concerned it takes really good low light pictures the flash responds well even in complete darkness it has a good enough zoom and the photos hold out well and dont look granular even when zoomed to a large extent in computer 2 super amoled display is stunning and at this price its a great addition 5inch screen gives great output for both still images and videos i am not a keen gamer so cant say much about its rendering of high end games though games like temple run 2 run smoothly 3 12 ghz processor works fine and i have not experienced any lag till now i am a big app addict and love to keep loads of apps installed in my phone and the speed is perfectly fine 4 the phone is very sleek and its form factor feels better compared to galaxy s3 or s4 those who have not used  a 5 inch screen before might find it a little difficult to handle initially but its superb display makes it worthwhile 5 there are a few very good features in the phone which you wont find in any other phone like the split screen display which lets you use two apps simultaneously it has a ups ultra power saving mode which which turns the phone into a black and white one and greatly enhances battery life it also has screen mirroring which gives direct output from phone to tv 6 there are a lot of preinstalled apps by google and samsung which cant be deleted which is a a bit annoying 7 there is a catch in the dual sim feature as there is no different slot for memory stick and one of the sim slot doubles up as a memory stick slot so effectively you can use either two sim cards or one sim and one memory stick at a time though 16 gb  internal memory of which around 12 gb is usable is enough for keeping quite a few apps songs videos and games and i didnt feel the need to have extra memory 8 battery performance is ok lasts almost for a day with average internet usage though i feel they could have given a little more than 2400mah considering that it has a 5inch display and its multi tasking features 9 volume rocker is on the left side of the display which makes it a little clumsy to handle if you are using a flip cover  overall a very good buy at this range though i have to admit at all samsung phones look the same but you get the 34samsung34 reliability and a good service network  ps  i got a 2400 inr cash back from paytm with the phone which was really useful this offer was given by samsung and paytm and could have been availed irrespective of where you buy the phone from dont know whether this offer is still on or not
2707	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	i bought this phone one month back in this phone features are 8 mega pixel rear camera  and 5 mega pixel front camera 15gb ram16 gb internal memory totally this phone is very nice no hanging no struck charging also good super phone
2708	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	actually this is not a dual sim phone in the second slot you can use a second sim or the memory card there is no separate slot for memory card transferring the data from the old samsung smart phone to this phone is not possible this facility is not good enough for execution
2709	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	using since about a month i dont play games therefore battery is super meeting requirements
2710	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	best performingslim  handy best part is ultra saving mode for long long battery life
2711	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	folks  i have been using it for 2 months  nd its awwwsome phone at 15k   reached my expectations  proscameratouchgreat battery life   pretty fast multi tasking display cons its getting hanged at navigation keys but its rare   no doubt i got another great product from samsung 
2712	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	nice slim and light weighted phone with some good specs and under a descent price
2713	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	amazing phone love it
2714	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	good mobile in this pricebetter to go for this phone compare to grand2
2715	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	this phone is g8 phone with lots of featers in this rate
2716	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	samsung galaxy e5 which i got was faultykeys were getting touched automaticallyphone has a heating problem when i tried to put the phone for packaging it was turning on again and again
2717	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	samsung product is waste of money you can buy other product like xiome micromax  samsung e5 the battery promblem and if you are useing 2g network then it work very very slow

2720	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	nice product but expectations were high and its not up to it  purchased it 3 months ago n its screen had broken due to battry degrade
2721	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	goodbut battery life is less
2722	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	unlike the a5 that came packed in a full metal body the galaxy e5 comes with a metal frame and the rest is plastic body rear side is black colour made of plastic matte finish give a good grip and soft to touch the handset still looks premium  there is outdoor option in brightness settings that will increase the brightness to maximum for about 15 minutes after which brightness will switch to default this is a good option to quickly increase the brightness when you are using the handset under direct sunlight  the screen is 5 inches 8211 it8217s super amoled supporting 1280 x 720 pixels resolution touch is smooth and responsive viewing angles are great  this is a dual sim handset with 3g support you will need 2 nano sim8217s sim slot 2 is hybrid slot that can either hold a nano sim or a micro sd card you cannot use both together  this handset is running android 444 kitkat with touchwiz ui  camera quality is above average rear camera can shoot full hd videos  the samsung galaxy e5 is a cheaper version of the galaxy a5 there are some specs changes that helped reduce the cost but this handset still does not compete with the lenovo a6000 price wise the galaxy e5 is priced at under rs 16500 though the e5 has an advantage when it comes to build quality and super amoled screen there is still a huge price difference
2723	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	good phone with excellent camera and battery life phone made for selfie crazy people
2724	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	gr8 look and feature and luv itamazing smartphone gr8 sp at reasonable price
2725	Samsung Galaxy E5 (Black)	good phone is this price but battery back up is not so great
2726	Intex Aqua R2 (Silver-Black)	i review this phone after 7 day use this is a average phone phone with basic features dual sim phone 1 normal sim slot and other was micro but this is not a 3g phone basic 2g phone its a android but you cant use main android appsinternal memory was very low you cant install youtube and whatsapp together memory not enough to install both these apps its not support flash so most of the other apps not working camera quality is poor and flash light is too low its touch screen and keyboard was very small so typing is very difficult and also battery not last even for 1 day i have to charge this phone twice a day other thing was speaker and 35mm jack are very poor even my  rs1500 headphones not gives good music experience and speaker was not clear but if you want a good looking phone with mp3 player fm bluetooth wifi dual sim and with decent touch screen then this is the phone for you this is the great looking phone and metal finish at back cover look awesome if you want to buy phone of around rs 2500 this is not the phone you want but around rs1700 its ok  but overall phone is ok not so good neither so bad

2746	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	just an absolute beast of a phone dont worry about the battery life just turn off bluetoothnfc google now and install samsung push service from playstore the battery life on ur s6 will skyrocket like anything fetching about 45 hours of screen on time on average auto brightness no need to even switch on the power saving and ultra saving modes dont go by the negative reviews and yes do buy the gold platinum one instead of sapphire black or white it just looks more like a premium phone you wont regret it for even a second the black and white ones look just like an ordinary galaxy s4 as a matter of fact the gold platinum version has a color shifting effect so according to lighting conditions it will shift its color from gold to silver it just gets a lot of attention due to its color shifting and it is awesome
2747	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	ive beeb using this phone for over 3 weeks now and below are pro  cons  pros beautiful looking phone and comfortable grip feels really premium decent amount of feauture or rather you can say there is something for everyone   software and hardware camera is superb dispatched is superb speak are decent and in some setup really good quality speed of the phone is excellent  better then iphone 6  my wife has a iphone 6 no lag whatsoever themes in built and in store are great and that too for free fast charing is really great feature i have fat fingers hence i love the samsung keyboard  special shout out  finger print scanner work perfectly fine  trust me i can go onabout pros for this phone  cons very poor battery life  hope fully software update can fix it  my verdict if you are in 2 minds  be rest assured you will not regret buying this phone  also i am a apple fan boy all of my other gadgets are of apple laptoptabletdesktop hence i do feel out of place sometime i am a hard core tech guy hence ecosystem does matter to me but i am still happy about the compraised i made 3 weeks back i am loving this phone cause of that started to appreciate andriod
2748	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	loaded hardware sleek and stylish faster processing better gaming experience front cam of 5mp is really cool sad part gosh it had waterproof and memory expansion slot which was more expected in samsung 
2749	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	every thing is fine but the battery must be 3000mah minimum capacity
2750	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	still waiting for the free wireless charger
2751	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	the phone its design n user interface are all the best samsung has done yet camera both front and back are fast n impressive design is very sturdy but the back glass makes phone slippery the only disadvantage is the battery which hardly lasts for a day with moderate usage charges from 5 to 100 within 90 mins which is really good
2752	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	it is certainly a revolutionary jump in controls and gimmicks  by samsung with this flagship phone i ve been an ageold user of galaxy s series phones and based on my thorough examination of s6 these are my findings pro great customization really fast charging turbo it is pretty handy apps like the beamer sidesync health monitor camera is simply rad esp at low lights sometimes brighter than what i could see with me bare eyes good tweaks in the design as opposed to the stereotypical samsung s series bar concept yeah yeah it looks like an iphones twin bro but who cares great looks with the samsung clear view cover i really recommend the silver one which could act as a make do mirror in emergency stunning display great keyboard cons drab touchwiz but other themes are available which is some solace to a loyal sammy user like yours truly you could find it difficult to keep track of some the addon features and some are plain useless at least to me and yeah samsung could go overboard with their innovation at times dont have much to boast about the speakers free wireless charger is a bust feels so fragile and i bet it is gonna shatter on the first drop so i would recommend a decent case battery literally leaks it would have been such a disaster without the turbo charging feature tends to heat up real quick  but to be frank amazon was simply superb with their delivery received within 2 days of purchase hats off
2753	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	defective product sold by seller ezeekart phone started over heating on charging and did not switch on even once after receiving very poor experience considering the premium price of the phone
2754	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	even though i love  live samsung here are some of my major disappointments with the new samsung galaxy s6  s6 edge  1 no mhl 3 to hdmi support  2 no usb 3  31  usb type c  3 no user replaceable battery  4 no micro sd card slot  5 no ip67 dustproof or waterproof  6 no glove mode for increasing touchscreen sensitivity  7 no led indicator notification menu just on or off option  8 smaller battery  9 no temp  humidity sensor  10 ever increasing size s4 was just 136mm in lenght and was very compact and convenient s6 is 8mm longer at 143mm with marginal increase in screen size  11 it is clear from various drop tests that s6 is not as durable as most samsung phones in the past  12 no way to sort apps in the app drawer only an edit option to manually sort each and every app and no way to move entire app drawer pages for arrangement  hope samsung incorporates these features in the upcoming note 5 and s7  please like and share this video so that this message reaches samsung and it incorporates these features in the upcoming note 5 and s7
2755	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	advantages 5134 quad hd super amoled display with 576 pixel density576 ppiisnt that the best in class 16 mp rear camera and 5 mp front camera the camera isnt the best in class but the features are amazing quick launch feature open camera in 07 seconds tracking auto focusit is a must have feature in any smart phone camera for focusing moving objects real time hdr photography indeed a cool feature but nowadays many phones seems to have it though ultra hd video recordingwe are talking about 4k resolution here and you guessed it right4k from a mobile fast chargingor should i say fastest chargingafter 10 minutes of chargingyou get 4 hours of use wireless chargingthis is a must have feature for any smartphonei just hate plugging in the cordsits frustrating samsung payit is an advanced paying system using near field communication technologyit seems like this technology is too new for india but it is certainly the future  disadvantages no sd card slot i do not even know a company like samsung did not provide an sd card slot samsung galaxy s6 does not have a new designyesthe samsung galaxy s6 edge looks amazing but s6 is nothing more than an upgraded s5at least in terms of looks costly i totally understand that its the flagship device of samsung but this thing costs a whooping 49000i think samsung should provide quality goods for less pricei meanthis is a freaking mobile
2756	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	this mobile is useless at this price 1 battery is just half day 2 back glass is just 05 mm gorilla glass same like tempered glass protector mine back glass has been shattered strangely itself without any physical damage and it was inside the cover but still broken in many lines i contact everywhere in samsung ceo or marketing and estore also i visit service centre also but they dont even want to hear anything after so many arguments they give me so expensive price for changing this weak small back glass  7800  which is equivalent  to cost of a nice quad core 534 mobile so after 6 days today they change my glass back  but again new glass with a small cut mark well done samsung for this dishonest pricing for small back changing good bye for your arrogance
2757	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	very good phone
2758	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	i got a gold platinum s6 64gb best android smartphone till date well secured now superb camera amazing display latest os 502 lollipop well built all over with gorilla glass 4 again a latest and alloy metal very classy at this price a must buy compared to iphone6 or iphone6 plus
2759	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	better than iphone 6 in every aspect for this price if touchwiz is a factor  you can always flash a custom rom to make it run even smoother than iphone 6
2760	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	the great people who are saying that this is a copy of iphone cannot see that 1 this is made of glass rather than aluminium in iphone 2 software is totally different than ios on iphone 3 iphone doesnt have an ir blaster on the top 4 iphone 6 has a white band at the bottom and up which is a style copied from htc please dont get fooled by the useless reviews i have personally used the device and also have seen a speed comparison with the iphone 6 it is much faster than the iphone 6 and the camera is outstanding
2761	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	this is the best smart phone iv ever usedi really appreciate samsung this one is so premium and its so fast coming to the camera its the best iv seen in the smart phone im really happy thank u samsung and thank u amazon
2762	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	only thing always comes to my mind when i use this phone is if it had a bigger battery samsung galaxy s6 is the best phone i have used till now best display best camera best performance loud speakers this phone has everything that a smartphone should have its nearly the perfect phone only if it had better or bigger battery you will get max 2hrs of screen on time with 3g and 4hrs with wifi not more than that so if you travel a lot this phone is not for you you should always have a power socket near you if you gonna use this phone as daily driver rest everything is top quality especially the camera you dont need to carry dslr if you have galaxy s6 phone comes with quick charge technology which means it will be fully charged from 0 to 100 in 1 hr 3045 mins 30 mins of charge will add 45 hrs of usage so if you can compromise the battery for all other features this phone is the one you should buy else go for galaxy note 4 or iphone 6 plus and 1s again super awsm phone
2763	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	just awesome 
2764	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	recently bought the device the drive is just awesome i got it for 30k from here link  httpamznto1g2bttu first i was nervous as i have bought samsung leaving apple asidebut when i got it i felt i had taken the good decisionamazing product no issues faced yet
2765	Samsung Galaxy S6 (Black, 32GB)	pros this is my 4th samsung phone and i must admit that the new touchwiz is really not that heavy like it used to be so the previous version was a bummer but this is razor fast and so fluid minimum change with the animation sound output is crisp but not like the boom sound of hits one series but the headphone output is better the phone has solidly built looks stunning in the sunlight too connectivity is fast so the fast charge it has the best display is the best ram and processor is perfect the camera is so good too it will get 51 in the month of july or on or before setting menu other software and everything are just fine cons its a power eater device octa core processor and it may get heated upunibody remember while data exchanging and other hardcore software using 1day average usage ps worth of every penny
2766	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	excellent mobile in the range below rs10000  i purchased it with so many hesitations  but after receiving the mobile within 24 hours of placing order i felt very happy as appearance cameras front  rear are very good  battery also giving very good back up with 5 types of options of display settings with easy operation  only loophole in this mobile is low volume of sound compared to my earlier sony ericsson which i have used for last 3 years overall its an excellent experience i had in buying this mobile thru amazonin
2767	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	it is best deal for this rate of android phone this phone flip cover experience amazing no hanging no hitting lollipop android version it is best android phone my point of view
2768	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	bought this mob before one monthi can say it has lots of advantagesesp battery back upawesome even if i play games and browse with 3g still it will last fr two days touch is gud2gb ram gives multitasking without any hanging so farbt camera is very pathetici say front cam is much more better dan rearso guys apart from camera if u wanted to go fr a mob under 10k i suggest u to buy this
2769	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	wrost phone at this range both of camera quality is too bad heat too much on normal uses sound quality is very low given head phone is too bad speed is good no lagging prblm on heavy game but heat too much battery life is good lasting 2days on normal uses given flip cover comes with good style best in 2gb ram 16gb rom smooth touch
2770	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	i bought it last week from amazon but the camera position is at top edge not seen like in given pics and back case for this phone is not availableand flipcover with this phone is poor quality camera clarity is below 8mp only and finishing of this phone is not good no heating problem and have a huge removable battery
2771	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	everything is good but camera and speaker sound and quality are just average 
2772	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	i impressed about this specs in low budged so i bought this mobile 2 weeks back  its camera quality is very very worster than 5mp camera so i recommend you dont buy this product such a waste of money frustrated  i dont understand why the people are giving 5 stars
2773	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	a nice mobile to me because by looking the features and camera qualityso the best mobile is intex
2774	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	im writing this review after 10 days of use first why i bought this phone well i already have huawei honor 6 and i needed another phone for my office number after much research i zeroed in intex aqua power plus i had my apprehensions but took the plunge  positives  battery battery battery yes as the name of the phone suggests it has a massive battery and it lives up to the expectation for the first time ever in smart phone life im not worried about evening and trust me i have used may phones be it samsung bb nokia microsoft i have 2 sims two gmail accounts on sync and many other apps which need internet connectivity i get many calls and my wifi is always on even if im not in wifi zone still the battery lasts and gives me a day and half of life line  and if im i bit careful on second day the battery will last entire second day too i dont use 3g   processor  ram it has got 2gm ram and coupled with decent processor performs well no visible prominent lag asking beyond this will be unfair from a 9k phone   screen screen is decent pixels are not prominent and beyond this it will be too much to ask  negatives  camera camera camera yes the camera is the worst aspect of the phone it is supposedly 13mp but still the pics are not of good quality you have to be extra careful while taking pic to avoid any shake or distortion i have huawei honor 6 a 20k phone its camera is good till you dont zoom and the moment you z900oom it there are lots of noise so looking at the contrast of the price if may be un fare to ask for a good camera but still i would have loved to have a decent performing camera  interface yes the interface looks sick out dated and tasteless even though the phone runs on android 50 luckily i have action launcher app so i used it to overhaul the interface it can be matter of personal choice but still   speakers ouch speakers are bad too so bad that even notification tones tunes sound shredded speaker are loud but awful  besides these i havent found any other flaw give that it is a rs9000  phone no over heating issue
2775	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	worst quality mobile must made intexspecs are good on paper but when you to start use it you feel the difference 1 no hd screen2 no glass protection 3 no automatic brightness 4battery drains very fast even 2000 man phones gives good backup4useless blotware 5no favourite apps6 no match of lollipop version with old chipset 13 ghz media core chip set 7downloading is ultra slower 8user interface is not attractive 8cartoon type app icons 9unnecessary msgs pops up every 10 minutes intervals built is plastic not metal 11 battery gets heated after 15 minutes of usesphone looks are premium but performance is far worst than 5000 phone
2776	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	i bought this phone 2 days back on a local shop in my city  after using it i found that this phone is not much as i expected from it dont buy it because the camera quality is not good as it is 13 mp but the actual camera quality is like 5 mp  the front camera is worst than i never thought the processing and multitasking of the phone is good as it has 2 gb of ram but the other things are worst so i recommend to buy micromax yu yuphoria instead of this phone  thank you
2777	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	i bought it just before two weeks it is worst camera quality is very poor dont buy it
2778	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	back cover second hand mil ga
2779	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	had bought this product from reliance retail chain a month ago when it was first launchedthe phone has a good cameraalthough the front cam which is said to b 5mp isnt upto the markwhereasthe rear camera is too goodhardware quality n the finishing matches nowhere with multinational players like samsung and htcthe usb cable suppliedbecame loose n broke down after 2 dayswhich made quite a tough time to find out a fast charging usb cable frm the marketalthough the battery is marked 4000 mahwith continious usage it lasts only 67 hours n with moderate usage upto 1012the phone doesnt heat much while charging but yes the charger heats like hellthus id like to conclude that if u r lookin for featured budget smartphones below 10000 go for this productsince indian brands like micromaxkarbon n othersall comes with rebranded made in china handsetsalso id like to inform if anyone buy this phonehe doesnt need to buy a flip cover n screen guard seperately as the packaging contains a window flip cover n 2 screen guards
2780	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	worst camera and battery  battery remains 5 hours camera is not better than mi 8mp camera  jst features are best

2785	Intex Aqua Power Plus (White-Champagne)	one of the best anrd phone 
2786	Micromax Canvas Pep Q371 (Blue)	awesome phone this is my third smartphone  but overall this is good phone the only one problem that i noticed that heating phone is heating while l playing big games such as temple run  subway surf
2787	Micromax Canvas Pep Q371 (Blue)	this model of micromax is heated too much while charging and also during internet surfing not as good as expected
2788	Micromax Canvas Pep Q371 (Blue)	good but sound low
2789	Nokia 105 (Red)	but the sound quality is not good as per the nokia basic phones  seriously doubt about the quality of the product
2790	Nokia 105 (Red)	it was a defective one how could amazon shift it

2798	Nokia 105 (Red)	vest of money
2799	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	its one of the best devices that micromax have ever made you may hear that it has some heating problems dont trust them it may be cause of the faulty product it gets heated up a little while playing games but its normal  so here are my key findings  good camera qualitybut not for a 13mp decent display awesome gaming performance no lags switching between apps average sound quality back leather type finish like samsung looks goodbut is plastic hate its gps doesnt work every time better batter backup then any other micromax device look and design wise not so attractive but was fine for me
2800	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	great phone this is not much different form the micromax canvas nitro a310 this has got an additional 8 gb internal storage  got this phone for 10999 on jan 1 2015 i bought this for my friend he has been looking to buy this for close to 2 weeks now  the phone got delivered within 48 hoursas always amazon rocks about the phone  pros  cpu is a octa core 17 ghz 2gb ram 16 gb internal storage ui is silky smooth up until now  it comes with a 13 mp camera that is having sony sensor picture clarity is amazing has some cool modes for taking different shots the secondary cam also does a decent job if the light is good  expandable to 32gb  dual sim support  screen guard is provided with the package  of course the price is very low when you look at the specs  light weight i have a sony xperia sp this feels lighter than it  cons  screen is not gorilla glass use of screen guard is a must  my friends have bad experience when seeking assistance from micromax support this is the biggest worry for me there are huge delays even if we seek help from sony or htc or samsung but micromax simply outmatches everything potential buyers can also do some research around this if you are worried about this you will trust me after your research  i could only see white and blue options a black model would have been better than a blue one its better to go for the white model than the blue one  the panel surrounding the lcd screen is still black in color so a white model is still has dark front area  i have worries about the battery life as the installed battery is 2500mah  and a friendly word of advice to potential micromax aspirants now  see if you can get the micromax yureka its cheaper than this
2801	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	i ordered canvas nitro after and exhaustive research and comparison of smartphones for about 2 weeks my budget was limited so i chose canvas nitro it came well within my budget and it is packed with everything which you expect from a highend smartphone looks are really impressive and it feels nice to hold it in hands performance is excellent
2802	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	phone is so so has good camera and features slim elegant display and as per features described in the advertisement thanks i would like to add few things after using the phone for three days continuously i felt it does not heat up extraordinarily and battery is also not draining out fast as mentioned in various reviews so far phone is working very nicely
2803	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	specifications and price both are really good as compared to other brand mobiles
2804	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	hit hay boss
2805	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	rewriting my review for the last one year i had become a fan of micromax cheaper phones high configuration etc i purchased 3 mobiles a tablet and a tv all from micromax exactly one year after i got the first micromax phone purchased on 18th march 2014 problem started 13th march 2015 display issues dead battery no network another phoen purchased around april 2014 and problem started feb 2015 display issues dead battery no network micromax customer care is pathetic they wont help you at all i tried reaching out to local micromax service stations in hyderabad 4 out of 6 addres given are fake and the contact numbers never work highly dissappointed with the experience i can understand that i paid less when compared to branded devices but this is pathetic im never gonna buy any more micromax devices enough spent thanks micromax for letting me know how cheap you guys are
2806	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	micromax canvas nitro a311 is a small upgrade to the already popular canvas nitro a310 the only notable difference is now it has 16gb of onboard storage the great thing is they are not pricing it higher for this extra 8gb internal storage coming with a311  overall performance is the same as a310 great for the price one of the best value for money devices in the market today software wise this is running android kitkat and there is uncertainty over whether this will get an android l update so i would recommend grabbing a micromax yu yureka if you could during the limited flash sales coming up as it has overall better specs and long term software support from cyanogen
2807	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	we bought this phone as a replacement for samsung galaxy grand what i like about micromax are pro  value for the money you are paying similar features on other brands cost twice as much  look and feel of the phone is great  the back leather cover looks and feels great as compared to a cheap plastic  13 mega pixel rear camera is performing great for those easy and simple to capture moments  5 mega pixel in the font is decent  battery is removable means that we can carry a spare one for emergency  con  it runs only a 442 and so that means to get that updated to latest we need to go through multiple updates  display and glass are not toughened glass  some of micromax customization on the os is irritating  that might be asking a bit too much for the price that we pay maybe  overall a great phone for a low cost will be using it for a few more days and will update anything more i find  update after using the phone looks like the camera has a challenge with auto focus all my videos are very shaky the camera that comes in the phone has white balance issues downloaded the google camera to fix that but imagines are shaky in google camera not a phone you can take videos
2808	Micromax Canvas Nitro A311 (White)	nice phoneworth of cost

2872	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	after using 1 month my experience 1 good battery backup you will never forget this experience 2 no hanging till now 3 almost all files are taken 4 screen display is good 5 pic quality good on day light on zooming some details are lost 6 180 grams weight is too more hurt your wrist a bit 7 install zero laucher nd change to a live wallpaper otherwise ull start hating amigo ui nd gionee 8 weil is lagging 9 lot of blogwares donno why dey put dis 10 if you are a traveller nd an internet guy nd need a carefree life take dis phone  but always remember micromax providing double specz at same price
2873	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	love the 5000 mah battery  it has such a huge battery yet the over all size of the handset is perfect its bit on heavier side its manageable considering the 5000mah battery
2874	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	one thing i must say that after using it for 7 days i am good with it at first when it came out of the box it had a lot of bloatwares and useless applications i uninstalled them kept the minimum one or which cant be uninstalled now the phone is running quite good one area which i find is the ram which sometimes fall short of need camera is very good in day light but indoors pictures are full of noise i dont like it after using s4 mini camera which was a super piece processor screen display material quality battery alll are awesome i didnt like the sound system much not able to try the hotknot feature otg is great and reverse charging is there optional one big thing is that its sd card system is made so that all the system and default files go directly to sd card like whatsapp pictures and vids store directly to sd card only so i am not worried about space as i am using 32 gb card a go for it choice for them who prefer more on battery uses and moderate smartphone features expect atleast one software update from gionee for making it smooth performance it lacksram wise
2875	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	i have been using this mobile for 3 weeks now the battery backup is just amazing i charge my phone once in 23 days battery lasts easily for an entire day even after heavy usage camera and video quality is very good if you are looking for a good phone under 20k you can blindly go for this

2877	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	nice phone with huge battery 5000mah a little lagging some timebut still finego for it if you love a long lasting battery camera is wowgrt quality but not mean for fast capture
2878	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	great phone best battery5000mahamazing camaragood internet speed best deal in its range i will recommend m3 to all my frndsgionee rocks
2879	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	best phone in this category rather than spending money on power banks and allbuy this phone amazing power backup5000amh easily lasts 23daysamazing quality cons little bulky no led light and no light up back keys if your main concern is a good phone with good battery this is itplus gionee service station are all over the country best buy 12500
2880	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	this is my 2 nd gionee mobileits not too heavyhandyno words to describe about battery go for it without 2 nd thoughts
2881	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	best battery life in n android phones and no hanging problem i was purchase it 3 month ago it work smoothly without any problem
2882	Gionee Marathon M3 (Black)	gionee marathon m3  5000mah  is the successor to the already popular gionee m2  4000mah  as the name suggests the most interesting feature of this phone is the huge battery it comes with  build quality good build quality overall with a matte finished back panel m3 is a bulky phone and is heavy thanks to the big battery inside the phone comes with a free flip cover in the box  display 5 hd display with good viewing angles  software this is powered by a mediatek mt6582 chipset and comes with 1gb of ram i would have loved seeing this powered by an octacore mt6592 instead like every other gionee phone in the market this too runs their custom ui  amigo ui on top of android kitkat this comes with a lot of software additions and tweaks offering better experience hotknot double tap to wake up etc are supported unfortunately since the ui is quite heavy comparing to stock android expect lags often  storage out of 8gb you get around 25 gb for apps you can choose sdcard as the default installtion location otg is supported  camera 8mp2mp overall quality of the rear camera is quite good front camera is a fixed focus one  battery the main reason for buying this device should be this huge 5000mah battery on board nonremovable it can go on and on the downside is the handset is bulky and quite heavy as of this writing no other phones ships with such a big battery  verdict buy this for batteryoverall performance of the custom ui on this is not that great since you can get octacore 2gb ram devices for the price this is shipping i would recommend getting those instead of this if battery backup is not your top priority

2921	Microsoft Lumia 430 (Black, Dual SIM)	this is as of now the cheapest lumia phone to hit the market yes a few sacrifices have to be made to make it just about rs 5150 but that doesnt mean poor quality or bad functioning in fact this phones specifications are pretty much better than what were used to  it is a 4 inch phone with an agreeably sharp resolution of 800×480 sharp because it is on a 4 inch sadly the display enhancement technologies like clearblack are not available ambient light and proximity sensors have been included meaning auto brightness will work here  the phone has a storage capacity of 8gb which is expandable to 128gb with an external sd card  the processor is a qualcomm snapdragon 200 soc with dual 12 ghz cortex a7 cores this is good since windows phone os is good with low end devices in terms of speed unlike on android  one will be able to access the whole windows store of applications as this phone has 1gb ram  the main camera sadly is just 2mp while the front camera 03mp this are the major drawbacks of this phone a 5mp camera would be better microsoft the phone comes with a 1500mah battery which is also too low for most users nowadays  opinion   is this a good phone yes  would i buy it if i wanted a low end windows phone no why because there is the lumia 535 which beats this phone in everything and ill only have to add a few thousands  but if one cant afford the lumia 535 then this is the one to go with
2922	Microsoft Lumia 430 (Black, Dual SIM)	purchased lumia 430 a week ago at reliance digital kamananahalli bangalore   not that i dont trust amazon service   at this price this phone is a super deal here are the pros and cons   pros  1 looks good in hand 2 the plastic back case is not at all cheap  looks and feels pretty decent 3 screen clearity is good  way better than karbon or micromaxx phones at this price range  4 1gb ram really does the job  phones operates smooth absolutely no lag whatso ever  8gb of memory 5 touch is very much responsive 6 battery back up seems good  should last one day  7 tried subway surfer temple run2  candy crush  hill climb and 3d chess absolutely no lag at all  8 amazing call voice clearity at both ends   cons   i would not be writing any points here considering the price range  but yes there are flaws which i noticed  1 no flash 2 camera picture quality is just ok in daylight  but a big no no in the night  goes same with the front camera  but you should still be able to make skype calls  3 not a con but yes keep those micro sims ready if you currently have a normal sized sim card 4 thinking hard to figure out more points  sadly not able to   bottom line  at this price of 5k from a good and trusted brand like nokiamicrosoft this product which can accomodate all the vital apps like whatsapp viber true caller skype simply download them all from windows store  etc etc what more do you need  just go for it if you are on a limited budget or wanna gift it to your mom younger sisbro in college  you know what i mean 
2923	Microsoft Lumia 430 (Black, Dual SIM)	i bought it as a secondary phone this phone is undoubtedly the best phone in this range the specifications are way better than other phones like moto e 1st gen samsung pro nokia lumia etc it not only has front and back camera  it also has 1 gb ram which no other mobile has yes the camera quality is not great but it is more than enough for a skype call i tried it as i said it is my secondary phone the needs from a primary phone might differ in your case windows os itself is way better than in this range phone doesnt lag ui is great voice quality is again a plus  you have to test other mobiles listed above to know the difference it is clear and not squicky or sharp it is dual sim so in all it serves the purpose very nicely  trust me i returned 2 phones before this and i finally bought this one
2924	Microsoft Lumia 430 (Black, Dual SIM)	a nice budget phone with all app you needdont think just buy itand enjoyi owe a lumia 520 and 535 both are great phonesamajon is worlds no1 site
2925	Microsoft Lumia 430 (Black, Dual SIM)	a good looking sturdy handset with smooth running the 2 mp camera takes better pictures than other 7 mp cameras in good daylight a decent handset at this price
2926	Microsoft Lumia 430 (Black, Dual SIM)	os  andriod  correct this
2927	Microsoft Lumia 430 (Black, Dual SIM)	good
2928	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	both the sim card slots are very badly damaged by any chance no sim card cam be inserted in the slots lost trust in amazon
2929	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	phone is nice but camera is just ok not that good as 13 megapixels and some times problem appears in speakers one works and another stops and again both starts but overall a nice phone with great looks
2930	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	its a pretty decent phone it comes along with a 13 mp rear camera and a 5 mp front camera it was a 1 gb ram  frankly im a gamer so the ram doesnt create an issue it works pretty fast the ram is supported by a quad core processor the battery life is also very good yep so its a must buy phone
2931	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	this is the best you can get at this price i got it for 15400 lucky me  pros touch is superb very slim light weight camera capture response time is very fast 5mp selfie cam size is big but still it doesnt looks like your are trying to hide your face  cons battery drains a little fast on 3g keep mobile data off when not in use  go for htc
2932	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	bought in reliance digital store all are good 1gb ram but never lags while gaming i have modified my u i into a 3d one but still not hanging  camera is good only some cons 1no video call without skype or other softwares  like wp 2accelorometer calibration problem htc needs to fix 3soemtimes gets heated up very rarely 4 back is soo vulnerable to fingerprints p
2933	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	its a nice phone for the price being offered no heating issues  no hang issuesonly demerit is you cannot transfer your apps onto your sd card to perform that action you will have to root your device
2934	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	never buy a htc product such a terrible service you might find the device fascinating but post sell service may prompt you to even commit a suicide  no responsibility and they work like a lazy bureaucracy  i made a mistake and forced some other as well but you people dnt do it  little description  going to write only drawbacks  things that are not here you can assume as super quality 1 battery deteriorates slowly 2 phone lags 3 network issue in sim 1 no matter what sim you use 4poor in call voice 5poor stereo sound 6very poor design of the mobile cover they give when i say very poor  i mean a single word of it 7heats up 8take years to charge and minutes to dischargeit will show 40 at 310 pm and might go to 5  at 320 pm of the same evening 9 they say 5 mp but front is not that goodit is better than other phone though 10 its ram is always full 11very poooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooor post sell service  rest is fine my advice  buy a brick  inr 500 and any phone at  4k5k you will have more fun   u will save 7k8k thank me later
2935	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	superb phone had some issues with touch but htc has fixed the same with an update it is upgradable to lollipopone more thing that i have observed while inserting a new or an old micro sd card pls take a backup and format it from the phone itself the problem from hanging will be resolved tried on all my htc phones and it works
2936	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	i am using this phone for the past 15 monthplease read proc  best look  design awesome camerafront  back  cons  within 10 days charger stopped workinggetting problem with rebootingmany time phone is very slowswitching between various application is slow again htc service center review  when i approached htc service center in gurgaon they said only one phone problem can be solved at one timefrustrated listening thisso i choosed to fix the charger problem firstthey assured to give me new charger with in 34 days but its been more than 15 days and charger is still in repairing mode  htc care do not reply via email with just only one mailyou have to email again and again to get their replyonce they provide me the charger then i will have to go again for other problems which i am facing  62 no option for different ringtone for each sim 62 no option to mute camera sound 62 pattern lock does not respond quickly and smoothly

2940	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	i have been using this phone for 20 days the phone is good best part is its music sound camera and signals there is some problem in touch htc has come up with update i hope to get this issue fixed after updating it

2944	HTC Desire 816G (Dual SIM, Blue)	despite of all these reviews htc desire 816g is a good phone of course  i bought from a local shop cons 1  does not support direct video callonly through skype or other softwares  2 camera as mentioned 13mp and 5mp are under 43 resolution just a marketing trickkeep the camera settings under full screen resolution then u will get 8mp and 4mp pretty good than other mid range phones 3u cannot move apps sidewiseonly up or down same for all htc phones u can install a launcher egapus if u dont like it 4does not provide multitasking  not necessa ry  5cannot control ph through  voice commands pros 1look and display are very very goodur phone  stays as unique cmp to other phones at this feature 2 even it is 1gb ram u will get more than 500mb for usage cmp to grand 2 where 350mb is usable out of 15gb 3processing and opening and closing of apps are very fast cmp to grand 2 4after doing above said settings u will enjoy video callings with good clarity 5 gaming is just superb wont stuck even u r out of game doing other work and reenter  in to gane it will start from where u stop 6speakers u will satisfy

2948	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	this is my first samsung and got it as a gift have usedowned androids from motorola htc lg  xiaomi as my primary devices  flagships mostly im using this as a secondary phone along with lg g3 so would be as unbiased as i can be  the good things  premium looks the metal frame is great and is aesthetically very appealing  specification wise its a notch above the motog build quality is better too motog consistently scores about 17000 on antutu this one scores above 19000 everytime  performance is great no lagsstuttersslowness whatsoever  not many phones from samsung can claim to be so due to the touchwiz ui but this one is quite different  display  bright and clear no pixelation is visible unless you get uncomfortably close to the screen 4 modes to adjust the saturationtemperature you wouldnt really miss a fhd display due to the samoled screen though probably you would be able to tell the difference if youre used to 1080p or higher  battery im pleasantly surprised how efficiently optimised this phone is dont go by the 2300 mah number  you must be pushing it hard to get a bad backup with this one  temperature this is among the most coolest phones ive ever used p i mean it just doesnt heatup like almost everything else does while setting up the phone at night the max temp i reached was less then 35c  not so good things   bloatware  theres a bit of bloatware  you can get rid of some of them and hide the rest isnt bothering the performance and the ram consumption is mostly below a gb cpu doesnt seem stressed either so probably you can live with it  update  as per cornings website a5 has a gorilla 4 protection  let me know if you have some questions about this one cheers
2949	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	as a nod to where samsung is heading with design the galaxy a5 is a great example of quality indeed i did rather have one in the pocket than the flagship galaxy s6  which fuses the best of both design and power worlds together  if youre looking for a slender attractive phone that has the main necessary feature set on board then the galaxy a5 does a grand job although the particularly savvy will shop around and with the likes of the more capable sony xperia z3 compact now available around a similar price point that might work against samsungs favour  after three days with the galaxy a5 my criticism is  few and far between i did like android lollipop on board for a more slick overall user experience the battery life could be even better yet and the camera is befitting of the midrange price point rather than being exceptional  but thats to be expected  its the marvellous exterior where the galaxy a5 really wins points acting as a hint of things to come from future samsung phones as a lesser powerful android alternative to the apple iphone 6 this handset will turn heads without costing a fortune to buy in the first place
2950	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	im using this phone from past 1 week noticed tge following 1 doesnt support otg biggest draw back for a good phone 2 performance wise is good 3 light weight 4 main camera 13 mp quality of pictures is nice so is the printout of pic is good 5 dual sim support but second sim can be used in the slot provided for microsd so can either use microsd or second sim 6 quality of sound is quite good 7able to catch the singnal of wifi at a good diatance  in comparison  with s3 note 3 neo  lenovo p780
2951	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	hey guys  i have ordered galaxy a5 from amazon  i got an on time delivery as usual im using the phone fr past one month  below are my reviews  pros 1very handy 5inch as this phone has metalic finish that too midnight black with silver outline gives a stunning  stylish look to the phone  i just love it  216gb of internal memory and 2gb  ram 3no heating issue im using nokia charger to charger my phone everyday still i dont find any issues but once i used to charge my phone with unbranded charger there i found a pblm 44g enabled where as 3g is more than sufficient today but at times when youre in a group it may put a smile on your face when people says wow  you have 4g for 22k  5battery which is very essential  a5 gave its best 6 photos with decent camera like 13mp for rear and 5mp for front the photos which i took with a5 are really excellent front cam rocks compared to any other smartphones that i have used 7display resolutions are good 8power saving mode is an added feature here  this is very useful during emergency casesi 9ui  touch sensitivity are amazing  cons 1volume call volume could be better anyhow thats not a big issue when u use your headphones but once you remove it then definitely 2 hanging issue not much but i have faced once but thats manageable  and im impressed with galaxy a5for sure ill recommend this to others
2952	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	though it is a costly dual sim mobile enjoyable but with regard to my opinion after inserting service providers dual micro sims in mobile there is no slot for inserting micro sd card for user needs and necessities for enjoying except internal memory of 16gb customer can not enjoy extended memory of 64 gb in the absence of sd card using service providers dual sims  extra slot provision also could have been made in the mobile  this is my view of as an esteemed customer using samsung 7722 mobile for the last 45 years of course not android any unrelated matter may please be dropped
2953	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	i bought one from nearest shop and its just awesome soft touchslim average heating cant feel heat with flip covers no complaints found
2954	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	with the a series we can conclude that samsung is trying to sort out the design problems it has had for years with the galaxy alpha the metal body was introduced in samsung phones but the back was still made of plastic but a series features full unibody design which gives the phone a sturdy feelsturdy yet not premium the ram is plenty for a phone but what seems to be a point of concern here is the processor which is comparable to the processors of a few android wearquadcore 12 ghz cortexa53 what that means is that while the phone feels snappy in daily tasks its exhibits a lacklustre performance in resource hogging tasks like gaming a great new feature is that the micro sd card slot doubles as a sim card slot to make the phone dual sim but that features compromises expandable memoryso to sum it up   pros 1 sturdy build 2 2gb ram 3 interchangeable micro sdup to 64gbdual sim card slot 4 nice camera13 mp rear and 5 mp front with features like wide frame selfies and animated gif selfies 5 super slim67mm 6 corning gorilla glass 4 7 battery lasts a day no issue though it is a 2300liion mah battery this is because both the screen and the processor are not as powerful so they could do well with less juice  cons 1 mediocre screen720p screen in year 2015 though its 294 ppi and its still difficult to spot pixels from a practical distance in 720p screen still higher resolution produces more vivid and sharp images though it is more taxing on the battery which becomes somewhat significant here as the battery is less powerful 2 less powerful processorquadcore 12 ghz cortexa53 3 sound is not good samsung should have put the speakers on the side rather than on the back 4 otg not supported 5 android 444 out of the boxan update may be on its way 6 metal back is prone to scratches 7 high price for the specifications  bottomline this phone has almost the same specifications as lenovo a6000 but is more costly the sturdy build and slim form factor makes the phone feel good in hand but still lacks a premium touch the camera is good and the comparable brother is galaxy s5 except for the fact that this phone is 12 ghz quad while s5 has 25 ghz quad core processor so while this phone is launched recently still it would be a better choice to stretch the budget a little bit and buy the s5 as this phone brings nothing exceptionally appealing to the table except for a sturdy design and a undue price
2955	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	bought from bahrain same model in one mall the new samsung galaxy a5 is just quite good and doesnt hang till nowit is quite good and it holds a 13 mega pixel primary camera which is quite good for skype calls though not so much like a movie it has  a really good clarity and it is 5 inch which is quite nice and the normal size for a smartphone and you can hold it in your hand with easeit has a friendly operating system and is quite easy to operate even for people who are new into the field of smartphones and touch phonesbut the thing is that samsung is with most of the people and it is not so rare  it is found in the hands of most people and brands like blackberry could be a better choice if you are looking for diversity from other peoplebut overall it is a really nice phone with a friendly os and we do not need much help if we are newby into touch phonesit is good for skype calls  if you are looking for a samsung smartphone for skype calls and other business purpose  just go for it
2956	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	volume control and power button are on same line if we press to control the volume power button also pressed and the line disconnected because of rear speaker we cannot keep any conversation as secret other features are fine

2966	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	good phone but big price  price about 18000 or less is better for it
2967	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	i didnt purchase this product from amazon but its sleek design and a complete metal body is something to mention i have never seen such a slim phone from the galaxy series before with full metal crafted body seeing the specs device offers 2gb ram13 mp rear and 5 mp front camera it comes with nfc and multi display feature phone is as handy and as good as pricey iphone6 in a nut shell go for this product at this budget to experience samsung at its best
2968	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	this is my first samsung and got it as a gift have usedowned androids from motorola htc lg  xiaomi as my primary devices  flagships mostly im using this as a secondary phone along with lg g3 so would be as unbiased as i can be  the good things  premium looks the metal frame is great and is aesthetically very appealing  specification wise its a notch above the motog build quality is better too motog consistently scores about 17000 on antutu this one scores above 19000 everytime  performance is great no lagsstuttersslowness whatsoever  not many phones from samsung can claim to be so due to the touchwiz ui but this one is quite different  display  bright and clear no pixelation is visible unless you get uncomfortably close to the screen 4 modes to adjust the saturationtemperature you wouldnt really miss a fhd display due to the samoled screen though probably you would be able to tell the difference if youre used to 1080p or higher  battery im pleasantly surprised how efficiently optimised this phone is dont go by the 2300 mah number  you must be pushing it hard to get a bad backup with this one  temperature this is among the most coolest phones ive ever used p i mean it just doesnt heatup like almost everything else does while setting up the phone at night the max temp i reached was less then 35c  not so good things   bloatware  theres a bit of bloatware  you can get rid of some of them and hide the rest isnt bothering the performance and the ram consumption is mostly below a gb cpu doesnt seem stressed either so probably you can live with it  update  as per cornings website a5 has a gorilla 4 protection  let me know if you have some questions about this one cheers
2969	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	as a nod to where samsung is heading with design the galaxy a5 is a great example of quality indeed i did rather have one in the pocket than the flagship galaxy s6  which fuses the best of both design and power worlds together  if youre looking for a slender attractive phone that has the main necessary feature set on board then the galaxy a5 does a grand job although the particularly savvy will shop around and with the likes of the more capable sony xperia z3 compact now available around a similar price point that might work against samsungs favour  after three days with the galaxy a5 my criticism is  few and far between i did like android lollipop on board for a more slick overall user experience the battery life could be even better yet and the camera is befitting of the midrange price point rather than being exceptional  but thats to be expected  its the marvellous exterior where the galaxy a5 really wins points acting as a hint of things to come from future samsung phones as a lesser powerful android alternative to the apple iphone 6 this handset will turn heads without costing a fortune to buy in the first place
2970	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	im using this phone from past 1 week noticed tge following 1 doesnt support otg biggest draw back for a good phone 2 performance wise is good 3 light weight 4 main camera 13 mp quality of pictures is nice so is the printout of pic is good 5 dual sim support but second sim can be used in the slot provided for microsd so can either use microsd or second sim 6 quality of sound is quite good 7able to catch the singnal of wifi at a good diatance  in comparison  with s3 note 3 neo  lenovo p780
2971	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	hey guys  i have ordered galaxy a5 from amazon  i got an on time delivery as usual im using the phone fr past one month  below are my reviews  pros 1very handy 5inch as this phone has metalic finish that too midnight black with silver outline gives a stunning  stylish look to the phone  i just love it  216gb of internal memory and 2gb  ram 3no heating issue im using nokia charger to charger my phone everyday still i dont find any issues but once i used to charge my phone with unbranded charger there i found a pblm 44g enabled where as 3g is more than sufficient today but at times when youre in a group it may put a smile on your face when people says wow  you have 4g for 22k  5battery which is very essential  a5 gave its best 6 photos with decent camera like 13mp for rear and 5mp for front the photos which i took with a5 are really excellent front cam rocks compared to any other smartphones that i have used 7display resolutions are good 8power saving mode is an added feature here  this is very useful during emergency casesi 9ui  touch sensitivity are amazing  cons 1volume call volume could be better anyhow thats not a big issue when u use your headphones but once you remove it then definitely 2 hanging issue not much but i have faced once but thats manageable  and im impressed with galaxy a5for sure ill recommend this to others
2972	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	though it is a costly dual sim mobile enjoyable but with regard to my opinion after inserting service providers dual micro sims in mobile there is no slot for inserting micro sd card for user needs and necessities for enjoying except internal memory of 16gb customer can not enjoy extended memory of 64 gb in the absence of sd card using service providers dual sims  extra slot provision also could have been made in the mobile  this is my view of as an esteemed customer using samsung 7722 mobile for the last 45 years of course not android any unrelated matter may please be dropped
2973	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	i bought one from nearest shop and its just awesome soft touchslim average heating cant feel heat with flip covers no complaints found
2974	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	with the a series we can conclude that samsung is trying to sort out the design problems it has had for years with the galaxy alpha the metal body was introduced in samsung phones but the back was still made of plastic but a series features full unibody design which gives the phone a sturdy feelsturdy yet not premium the ram is plenty for a phone but what seems to be a point of concern here is the processor which is comparable to the processors of a few android wearquadcore 12 ghz cortexa53 what that means is that while the phone feels snappy in daily tasks its exhibits a lacklustre performance in resource hogging tasks like gaming a great new feature is that the micro sd card slot doubles as a sim card slot to make the phone dual sim but that features compromises expandable memoryso to sum it up   pros 1 sturdy build 2 2gb ram 3 interchangeable micro sdup to 64gbdual sim card slot 4 nice camera13 mp rear and 5 mp front with features like wide frame selfies and animated gif selfies 5 super slim67mm 6 corning gorilla glass 4 7 battery lasts a day no issue though it is a 2300liion mah battery this is because both the screen and the processor are not as powerful so they could do well with less juice  cons 1 mediocre screen720p screen in year 2015 though its 294 ppi and its still difficult to spot pixels from a practical distance in 720p screen still higher resolution produces more vivid and sharp images though it is more taxing on the battery which becomes somewhat significant here as the battery is less powerful 2 less powerful processorquadcore 12 ghz cortexa53 3 sound is not good samsung should have put the speakers on the side rather than on the back 4 otg not supported 5 android 444 out of the boxan update may be on its way 6 metal back is prone to scratches 7 high price for the specifications  bottomline this phone has almost the same specifications as lenovo a6000 but is more costly the sturdy build and slim form factor makes the phone feel good in hand but still lacks a premium touch the camera is good and the comparable brother is galaxy s5 except for the fact that this phone is 12 ghz quad while s5 has 25 ghz quad core processor so while this phone is launched recently still it would be a better choice to stretch the budget a little bit and buy the s5 as this phone brings nothing exceptionally appealing to the table except for a sturdy design and a undue price
2975	Samsung Galaxy A5 (Midnight Black)	bought from bahrain same model in one mall the new samsung galaxy a5 is just quite good and doesnt hang till nowit is quite good and it holds a 13 mega pixel primary camera which is quite good for skype calls though not so much like a movie it has  a really good clarity and it is 5 inch which is quite nice and the normal size for a smartphone and you can hold it in your hand with easeit has a friendly operating system and is quite easy to operate even for people who are new into the field of smartphones and touch phonesbut the thing is that samsung is with most of the people and it is not so rare  it is found in the hands of most people and brands like blackberry could be a better choice if you are looking for diversity from other peoplebut overall it is a really nice phone with a friendly os and we do not need much help if we are newby into touch phonesit is good for skype calls  if you are looking for a samsung smartphone for skype calls and other business purpose  just go for it

3018	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	bought this phone from croma in exchange of my old mobile for 25500at this pricethis is one of the best smartphones available in the marketyou may think htc 820 costs 22000 but it doesnt give you full hd screeni was also considering lg g3 but its design is not great and camera is poorer the major advantages of this phone are 1stunning designi have the champagne gold colour n it looks beautifulevery bit of it 2awesome front and back camera 3full hd display 4fantastic keyboardits the best i have used so far 5very responsive touch 6good browsing experience 7i dont play a lot of games but the ones that i play like stick cricketreal cricket 14 and real racing play without lags 8have faced no heating issues at all 9awesome music player 10and the best feature  battery lasts 2 days if you enable power saving modealso comes with ultra power saving mode which gives standby time of upto 10 daysgood feature to use during travel the touch wiz ui used by samsung has a lot of features to offer a wonderful customer experiencei am very happy with the product the only cons i found is that when you place a call on loudspeaker the volume is low and the alarm doesnt have the rooster alarm tonepeople are comparing this to note 4but honestly how many people will use all the features offered in note 4 like the heart rate sensorthis phone has all the features that we need for everyday use the best part is the design update  theres some heating after playing games for awhileto counter thisi downloaded cooler master app from google playthe phone cools down in 34 minutes after you stop playing gamesone word of advice to prospective buyers  though the phone looks stunning it seems a bit fragile to meyou need to take good care as the metal frame may be damaged in case you drop it update after 3 months  my charging adapter stopped working due to a short circuithowever the service center promptly replaced it as soon as i visited them
3019	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	the mobile seems fine but it is too early to make a final comment the metallic body heats up if you talk for more than an hour battery runs out if it is not on power save mode it is said that with upgrade to lollipop battery performance will go up by 30 but lollipop is not yet made available by samsung in india for this model overall i like this phone for features and looks
3020	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	a great stylishgold with combination of dual sim  big screen  hifi hardware  better battery life
3021	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	i am very much satisfied with this phone slimstylish hd dislaygreat cameraetc etc gud buy from amazon
3022	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	i would like to buy but i am waiting for price drop because most samsung device usually  launched at over pricefew drawback are1 processor 615 mostly in 10000 price phone 2front camera if a9 is launch at 32000 price i will definitely buy
3023	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	worth the price it is sold for value for money
3024	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	gud buy from amazon i love this moblie
3025	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	overpriced
3026	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	good phone with nice body finish
3027	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Gold)	the first samsung smartphone with a full metal body the samsung galaxy a7 boasts an innovative luxurious design and a stunning 55inch fhd with 141g and with 2600mah battery has no removeable battery and sar value  there are several advantages and disadvantages the samsung galaxy a7 has a 2g gsm for easier phone and sms conversingfor video communication this smart phone has a 3g hsdpa network a faster version than any samsung model has had beforethe phone in itself supports a 4g lte system for a bigger variation of elements and a faster response to touches and commandsthe samsung galaxy a7 gives you a chance to insert two sims and opening a brand new world of aspectshas an internal space of 16 gb while you can also insert a memory card that measures up to 64 gbthe screen density of samsung galaxy a7 goes up to 267 ppi pixel  the nonremovable battery that comes along with the samsung galaxy a7 does not allow you to change it if any sort of mishap occurs and the battery is ruined if the battery is ruined your whole phone is its battery capacity is not very withstanding ad is prone to be used up very quickly if you run heavy apps on it the price range is very high which prevents some individuals from not purchasing this phone  although this android version is pretty god but for a phone so expensive  a better and more modernized version was needed
3028	Xolo One (Black)	thats perhaps the best phone available in this price range better than android one phones in each n every aspect except the camera cons it lacks autofocus and front camera is only vga battery back up fpr this price range is very nice antutu score of my phone 18800  i got it locally from chandigarh i did not like redmi 1s  this phone guarantees android l for sure so go for it without even a single thought you wont regret buying this heavy games work fine without lag but for heavy camera users its no briefly a very smart feature loaded phone  overall very satisfied with phone
3029	Xolo One (Black)	pros good display good battery backup depends on your usage average camera head phones are ok very comfortable to hold in your hands almost looks like a premium phone within 55k not bad at all  processor is awesome this phone can play almost any game in the play store  trust me i am a gamer  you get 194 gb of internal memory after you update to lolly pop  cons speakers and front camera are not that good
3030	Xolo One (Black)	had purchased this phone for my mom after extensive online research but sadly it did not turned upto my expectation there is a heavy heating problem on the phone after simple task like calling after a 45 mins call you can use it as hot massage bar if this issue is resolved then this phone can be my choice again rest all the features are awesome
3031	Xolo One (Black)	i am a certified buyer  its a good phone comprising all features uptill  and phone quality is good too
3032	Xolo One (Black)	awesome  phone fitds in everyones budget   if u r thinking of buying a phone under 6ooors then this phone suits you   fast processor and preinstalled android lollipop version  that s all we need 
3033	Xolo One (Black)	it fullfills my expectations good performance nice camera clearity and features of android lollypop is also nice in mid range price its a perfect mobile  delivery is  very fast and packing is also impressive
3034	Xolo One (Black)	this mobile is working good coming to speakers externally they are not working properly less volume  buzz sound is coming when i keep high volume remaining every thing is good weight less fast working looks smartly
3035	Xolo One (Black)	nice future for this range camera result also good very hug apps stored and 8 gb internal memory  its good cell phone and latest up gradable this system nice performance enjoyyyyyyyyy with xolo one
3036	Xolo One (Black)	its a super cheapest smart phoneill give 4 star1gb ram  8 gb rom super camera picture quality but video picture quality is not good
3037	Xolo One (Black)	very good product in this price   i analyzed the market in this price range there is no other device as good as xolo one
3038	Xolo One (Black)	this is d best phone in dis price range some websites like ebey snapdeal etc are selling it in aroud 55k n u can also apply some coupons on them then it will cost u around 5k only  first thing to be noted that xoloone is not an androidone set which means u will not get the android updates for 2 years like other androidone mobiles  good thing is that xolo has released lollipop 50 update 5578 mb on 16th jan 2015 which has amazing  mindblowing features i am d first one in my city to have it in my mobile yippee  all d androidone users are still having baba ji ka thullu  camera is not good due to lack of autofocus but video capturing is just amazing  next gud thing about xolo one is both d sim slots are 3g so we can use 3g service on either of d sims  battery performance is excellent in 2g mode but with 3g mode u hv to be careful  most crucial difference is in d  looks xoloone has no comparison with any androidone sets i just fall in love with it in a single look it is just sexy  all d other androidone sets from micromax spice n karbonn are bulls in looks  my final verdict go for xoloone in 55k range
3039	Xolo One (Black)	xolo is an androidone partner but xolo one is not an androidone device even though it has almost the same specs as those android one devices from micromaxkarbonn and spice  performance  quadcore mt6582m is more than enough for your daily day to day tasks you can even play many of the popular games without much issues  software xolo has released an android lollipop update  jan 16th  for this device which is great considering official androidone devices supported by google are yet to get this updateadvantage androidone devices have over this is that they will get software updates for 2 years or so from google while support for xolo one ends with android l update  camera as you can expect in a budget device like this average battery 1700mah not enough if you use 3g data a lot androidone devices have the same capacity battery this wont last one day of moderate usage with 3g on  xolo one vs androidone even though xolo one got android l update before android devicessupport for this device ends there while androidone devices will get updates for another 18months or so one advantage xolo one has over androidone devices is it has better build quality it comes with a leather back and looks better overall
3040	Xolo One (Black)	battery is draining very fast and heating problem is there as well
3041	Xolo One (Black)	its amazing phone realy good no comment 4 this phone

3048	Micromax Canvas 4 Plus A315 (White-Gold)	i bought this phone from store and used this phone for a week   everything good about the phone 62looks steals the show same as iphone 6 62very slim and light weight easy to carry and handle 62decent camera not great but ok 62good battery while only calls and with out net usage only 20 charge is enough per day while continuous usage for movies music and games  it comes for 6 hrs  i noticed only few drawbacks 62 very very low audio while playing music and movies quality is good with out disturbance but sound very very poor can be used to listen music or see videos only in a closed room or only with headphones 62 phone faces a small lag while multitasking as ram is just 1gb this is observed only while playing heavy games so you can ignore this if you are not a heavy user 62 though the internal memory is 16gb  memory given for app installations is 2gb we can move apps to sd card or root to avoid this   my final verdict i would have rated 55 if the audio output was good you can go for it but worthy only if not greater than 1314k
3049	Micromax Canvas 4 Plus A315 (White-Gold)	bought it one web k ago itrs a great phone its slimm easy to carry annd looks like iphone amoled screen and the colours are great can play most of the games like mc 4 etc without lag the camera is gud but not that great bcz auto focus not fast but over all if ur buying micromas i recommend to canvas 4 plus battery is ok smooth
3050	Micromax Canvas 4 Plus A315 (White-Gold)	im quite happy using the phone excellent camera quality best for selfies and amazing features however the disadvantage with the phone is usage of internet 2g and 3g the battery drains very fasti dont play games or surf the internet however i always keep my internet on 2g and sometimes on 3g network the battery level on 2g is good enough or me to use the phone for entire day however when i keep it on 3g the battery gets consume very fast and  drains within half a day  however over all lovely phone and quite good enough to rate a 4 for this phone i would definitely recommend this to my friendsguys also if you plan to buy this phone do pick it up in the white and gold color as it looks awesome in it  thanks
3051	Micromax Canvas 4 Plus A315 (White-Gold)	it has just been two days after i has bought my micromax canvas 4 plus a315  it is such a wonderful product for such a low price i had almost checked 60 phones and compared each one before i came at the conclusion of buying this product and now i am fully satisfied with this phone the camara quality has impressed me a wide range photo shoot picture clarity is what impresed me but although 13 meg pixel real pixel clarity is nor provided but a real good rate of 4510 can be given some of the defects that i could sort out  in the battery life  that about 2000mh is pretty low for a phone having this much specification and heating of the phone at the back top when phone over used apart from this the phone is very good for a price this low and i prefer this phone to buyers seeking a good moble in the range of 10000  14000 especially when you are fad up with the phones of this price rang that hangup after a long use

3054	Micromax Canvas 4 Plus A315 (White-Gold)	cheap micromax product worst camera i have ever seen it says 13 mp but worth only 3 mp and almost all headphones are unsupported would give negative stars if possible

3057	Micromax Canvas 4 Plus A315 (White-Gold)	i didnt like it for its screen resolution look of the phone are no doubt good but the quality of the screen was bad i ordered it specially for its amoled feature but i found it not up to the mark and return the phone  thanks to amazon for its wonderful return policy which saved my money i got my money back in 45 days

3068	Lenovo A369i (Black)	bought lenovo a369i 4 days back awsome delivery by amazon got the handset delivered in 26 hours  delivered on sunday regarding phone 1 overall a very good phone for the quoted price at amazon fully satisfied from what was expected  is delivered in the handset checked all features except wifi each feature details below 2 battery recharged fully for the first time for 3 hours battery lasted for 33 hours before reaching 15 used 2g for 20 hours calls attended for 2 hours games played for 15 hours used single sim during this time disabled all unnecessary features like background sync vibration on touch animated wallpapers live after 8 to 10 days of use completed 23 charge discharge cycles now my battery lasts for 6065 hours before reaching 15 3 phone network good as i found but in areas where there is less coverage my old smartphone worked better could have been a bit better but satisfactory as at major areas we get full coverage 4 3g  2g have tested both works fine 2nd sim might be enabled only for 2g as i see only gsm emborsed on the sim holder while primary sim holder reads gsm  wcdma 5 screen pretty decent size touch is also sensitive capacitive good not an extremely bright  colorful screen like the 15k  phones but good 6 storage installed 45 applications overall space available is 127 gb for installing apps i still have 850mb storage available for installing apps 7 voice quality is also good not less audible in crowded areas too 8 rig tone sound is also decent not very less 9 used the games provided in the phone eg fishing joy  diamond wonderland works decently i am not game freak so just played for some time to test the phone if it encounters some issue like hanging slowness etc worked fine 10 headphones are also ok quality sound quality is good but not very comfortable to wear large ones without cushion not like samsung which go inside the ears 11 tested radio works fine 12 tested wlan wifi shows networks available in the vicinity but did not try to connect as all were locked networks  required password 13 bluetooth works fine transferred files work good also connected to car stereo system  was able to use as handsfree made  accepted calls through the car stereo works fine 14 tethering connected to internet through my phone network using tethering work fine used wlan tethering as well as usb tethering easy to setup  works fine 15 using as usb storage connected to my laptop for transferring files to phone sd card works fine 16 used super backup application to transfer contacts calendar sms calendar backup did not work for me rest worked 17 no gps in this phone navigation cannot be used
3069	Lenovo A369i (Black)	the good cellphone at this pricei bought this as my secondary phone and happy to get the best at this price pros 1 fast and no lags 2 smooth touch with bright and pretty good display 3 3g on for whole day and battery died at night comparatively good battery life 4 sound is good and nonnoisy 5 one good feature i observed is its scheduling feature for power off and on that is very hard to find on other phonethis feature makes phone battery life looooong 6 camera quality is good and 34there is no front camera34 as mentioned in description for video calls cons 1 do not play pretty heavy games as its not meant for 2 continues use of phone chat web browsing etc for 20 mins heats up the device 3 ui is lenovo customized and believe me its not as much impressive 4 cannot upgrade to future version of android
3070	Lenovo A369i (Black)	awsome product at unbeatable price best configuration comes in this small packet must buy  lenovo rockz always big screen 422 jelly bean 13gz processor 2mp camera 3g wot more u want
3071	Lenovo A369i (Black)	well purchase was not very smooth  seller had charged shipping cost even it was showing free after a followup amazonfinally amazon had returned the shipping costthanks to amazon  regarding product i am using is as a secondary mobile mobile is good  very loud and clear sound  i am reviewing it after using it for 7 months  i will recommend it for those who dont want to use it for gaming  if requirement is only whatsapp and voice calling then it is good choice else you may face some lagging and it will be little slow bit no hanging issue  i suggest to install clean master app to clean the memory on screen off which cleans the memory and temp files  battery only last for a day
3072	Lenovo A369i (Black)	got this device at just rs 4395 from amazon  you may check for best prices at mysmartpricecom    i know that you must be fed up of the reviews which are nothing but the description itself so here i am giving some outoftheway pros and cons pros   1 voice recognition  voice recording and voice recognition is simply the best   2 camera  compared to 2mp this camera is offers really good quality for those who want to use camera just to take photos of the notices on the blackboard and of the pages of friends notebook this camera is more than enough   3 brand name the brand name matters as the accessories of micromax and karbonn devices are not easily available   4 extraordinarily fast processing during usage it had no lags whatsoever and it worked really very smooth for eg when we capture a photo it gets processed within a millisecond and we are ready to take the next photo  but for the same thing my friends micromax bolt a47  which has 13 ghz dual core processor  it takes at least 2 second to open the camera   5 battery life for low to medium usage the battery drops by 20 daily   6 touch the touch is just awesome cons   1 viewing angle the display is almost ips but surprisingly when viewed from vertically upward we cant see anything  that is really a headache for the gamers   2 no system upgrades we have to use the same android version throughout which is preinstalled even the flagship smartphones of lenovo are waiting for upgrade  courtesy vishkicom   verdict   those who want to use basic features of a smartphone who are non gamers and who want a long living meticulous device this is the best buy at any price range
3073	Lenovo A369i (Black)	hi all  i purchased this phone on 2 october 2014 and within 48 hours it was delivered good going amazon and for the past 6 month i have been using it as rugged as a phone can bare it  well my initial review was about functionality and features of this phone but in this review i am going to list the pros and cons is terms of specifications which i had to faced and observed after 6 months of usage  61692 display  8226 pro  the display comes with approx 233 ppi pixel density which makes it crisp and bright compared to other mobiles with this pixel density it is good to watch hd movies and videos on small screen  8226 con  the screen size is mentioned is 4inch but the ration of screen to body is 574 and the main con is when you tilt it to your right the screen is fades and on the other side it gets darkened it orientation might vary depending on the positioning of the phone in your hands  61692 battery  8226 pro  as per the phones specifications listed on lenovos website it states that it comes with 1500mah battery providing talktime of 14 hours 30 minutes and standby time of 288 hours whereas for the past 6 months the reality is that with talktime and 3g usage on occasionally watsapp utube etc it will provide you a healthy support for atleast 1820 hrs and with continuous it can with hold upto only 1012 hours 8226 cons  well if you are watching a movie let8217s say about 145min it will heat up pretty badly and if the brightness is full then the battery from 100 will drain in nearly half  61692 memory  8226 pro  well with ram of 512mb only 450mb is accessible and with 4gb of ram with latest phones this is not a pro at all but in this price of 35k its huge and with this brand the optimization and dividend among the apps is sufficient to run the benchmarked game 34temple run 234 with an ease and in terms of rom ie internal memory it comes with an approx of 125gb and another of 13gb alongside with andriod 422 jellybean combining upto roughly 3gb but you can use 32gb sd card and there is no lag in that as i am doing it 8226 con  well you have give up online gaming with this one as it doesnt supports a lot many of them and the one which it supports laggs a hell lot of  61692 camera  8226 pro  it does come with a 2mp camera and with more than ample amount of light the picturevideo is perfect 8226 con  it doesnt have a front facing camera so goodbye skype and other video calling apps and it also doesnt have flashlight and that is a bummer if you are a photo mad then please do not go for this and it does comes with panorama  smile detection but the smile detection is not that great it like you have to smile like a mad person then only it will detect it and as for panorama oh god its just there for namesake  61692 user interface  8226 pro  it comes with a preinstalled launcher from lenovo and for the andriod beginners its great in terms of user friendly and with navigation but as always you can opt for various other 3p launchers available in play store with which you can play like next launcher go 8226 launcher and my favourite doodle launcher 8226 con  firstly after few days of using the preinstalled launcher i was bored and then i installed many other 3p launchers but that actually made this phone very slow and nonresponsive to many high end launchers a 3p launcher actually consumes the ram a lot and the launch buttons at the bottom of the screen are not coloured and that is a real bummer to use it in night  61692 gaming  8226 pro  games under than 100mb like temple run 2 candy crush subway surfers flow free bridges hungry shark evolution etc will run smoothly without any lag or any glitches 8226 cons  as mentioned above along with the ram compatibility there is not much to experiment with online game or with games more than 100 mb of storage  61692 conclusion  this is one of a kind device for normal usage with andriod os on top of a brand like lenovo but the cons outweigh this phone in every aspect like memory camera gaming display etc but with 35k as a price with these features combined what more can you expect and so far there were some issue with heating 34occasionally34 but not like everyday but like based on continuous usage and to monitor i installed du battery saver to keep track of my battery performance  the main hassle was finding a decent cover for this phone there are like none to zero chances of availability of covers in the market and online you will only find from zero to few and i have like 5 covers but none of them actually fits perfectly but you have to make the best of it  i have uploaded some pictures of its specification according to cpuz app and some of the picture from its camera  61692 and thanks for giving your valuable time for reading such a long review
3074	Lenovo A369i (Black)	i purchased this device last week and my mic n speakers stopped working so cannot communicate i initiated a return i wouldnt recommend this product to others
3075	Lenovo A369i (Black)	no hanging problem  no battery issue at present  application running as per expectations  camera too poor  audio medium quality though clear
3076	Lenovo A369i (Black)	bought it in 2k in thursday blockbuster deal kind of steal deal considering that a 3g phone with dual core 4gb rom and 434 screen from a brand like lenovo does not come in 2k anywhere but thats all about it phone is decent in terms of display speed and performance there is no lag for normal usage and you will be happy with all other basic features that you anticipate in a budget smart phone i was disappointed largely by the fact that while amazon description states phone has gps it does not have any i am a cyclist and i need to record my daily trip as well as use the navigation feature while exploring new trails hence the gps becomes a critical factor in my phone but if you can live without gps then you may very well consider buying it in 2k else better wait for xiaomi or meizu to launch budget phones below 5k httptimesofindiaindiatimescomtechtechnewsxiaomitolaunchentrylevelphoneonapril8reportarticleshow46744740cms they would be more worthy to purchase
3077	Lenovo A369i (Black)	mujhe mera product nahi mila mujhe bahut tension ho rahi hai seller se bat karne ka bhi to koi tarika nahi hai dher sare emails bhi bhej chuki hun lekin koi reply nahi mila seller  ka number bhi galat hai kahi mere sath koi dhokha to nahi hua
3078	Lenovo A369i (Black)	the mobile is ok it has covered all my requirements but battery backup is causing concern
3079	Lenovo A369i (Black)	pros 113ghz dual core processor and 512 mb of ram at this price 2games like temple run subway stick games run smoothly on this phone without hanging 3with decent usethe battery backup is good almost 1 and half day 4performance of the phone is excellent you get ram cleaner and share it apps pre installed which are very useful 5the android interface and the touch both are decent  cons 1only 2mp camera but compared to other 2mp camera the picture quality is very good 2the display is a little difficult to see from certain viewing angles in sunlightthat doesnt mean you cant see anything but also you cant see everything from certain viewing angles 3gps is not there but agps support is there  suggestion will be to go for it its the best buy if you are not bothered about the camera and the gps

3082	Lenovo A369i (Black)	for first two months the phone was working really well and i was impressed but last week i had kept it for charging after 25 to 30 minutes there was a sound like a small cracker when i saw there was black smoke the area near the charging point of the phone is smoked and the screen was also cracked  need to take it to the service centre also there was no fluctuation of power during this time not sure why it happened  if you are already using this phone please dont charge your phone near your bed or near any inflammable items also stay away from the phone while charging and please dont use the phone when it is getting charged
3083	Lenovo A369i (Black)	i searched about more than 25 cell phones in internet and most of them have some drawbacksbut when i found this onei stopped my searchand why notif you are looking for a compact mobile under the range of 4k aroundi will say no other cell can compete with this pros  1it comes with 13 ghzdual core processor which gives you interrupt less application processing 2512 ram and 4 gb rom 3feather touch 4wide screen 5awesome displayit supports 1080p hd videos 6good internal memory4gb where 125 gb is available for user 73g connection superb 8and one thingit has not micro simit has normal simi was worried first because micro sim makes the sim cards unusable in other phones drawbacks no such drawbacks about this mobile 1battery back up is average 2does not have front camera 32 mp rear camera only at least you can not expect more than this in this price range  go for it for ultimate experience in your price grip

3135	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	i got this on 7th february 2015 through amazon as always i was surprised by the delivery time and overall packaging of product  first impression surprised by its 6 inch large size and look but still very comfortable in hand  as an addition some important things about this phone  1  the 768 x 1024 resolution display is awesome for playing hd videos reading ebooks 2  the size is great but exactly fit in palm 3  the windows 8 upgradable to 81 operating system is brilliantit looks sharp and stunning in the 6 inch display 4  the outlook compatibility is fantastic and other office application is just awesomeall are preinstalled 5  output sound quality in loudspeaker mode or in headset is very good 6  battery life is massive so you just do not think about to purchase a power bank 7  it has 64gb external memory supportwith 8 gb internal so all your apps can be placed in microsd card 8  touch is very smooth 9  it has 5 mp camerawith auto flash but picture quality as same as 8mp camera 10performance unbelievable with 1 gb ram and qualcomm snapdragon s4 dual core processor
3136	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	amazing service by amazon and super phone by nokia just loved it resolution smooth touch gaming battery awesome loved it
3137	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	i will keep it simple my search criteria was 1 big screen around 5inches 2 hd display i looked all the phones which fit this criteria best in quality and price is nokia 1320  apart from this which is my video viewing criteria 1phone is simply awesome 2im not a big fan of windows os but i started to like it 3music is the best part with nokia music your fav song is few clicks away 4pdf reading is good with the big screen 5and obviously hd and br print videos have excellent lay back that you quit watching in theatres   its really good 6 gaming part i really dont play high end games but till now no issues  cons 1 camera 5mp is not that great but cam apps are the coolest one to play around  2 internal memory is 8gb compensate with external this will not be a problem 3 customization as you know its windows   i can write review including ram processor and other extra technical info but at the end that doesnt really matter  its about the looks call facility gaming and entertainment with 135k this is the best one which satisfies all these no other thinking just go for it
3138	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	i will make the review pretty simple  the moment i pulled it out of the packing i fell in love with the phone the build quality is stellar the phone looks really really really good and it is just as good to hold  i have large hands and the 6inch beast of a phone fits well do not expect it to feel and look as good as the stunning large and the svelte nexus 6 and you will just fall in love  i am an android lover and i love my devices rooted and playing ball this was one of the two major disappointments i have had with the phone i cannot root it and play around with it but for those who do not give a damn it has all the major apps working supremely fine  another downer is the incredibly poor secondary camera it is just a vga cam and the photos look really grainy the front camera is not good for anything more than video calls that too only when strictly necessary  all in all if you are an android junkie and want to test how wp looks and feel you really cannot get better than this at any price point  also the dedicated camera key yaaay
3139	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	the nokia lumia phone has been a good experience after using and going through all os viz android kitkat 44 and ios 70 overall meets the expectations though the camera at 50 mp is still short of expectation with a smartphone for the price the better option is video recording which is superb i havent been a gamer on nokia phones for which i think you have android appsios apps as better option the responsiveness of touch screen is not great though with the large 634 screen and slim phone handling it is a problem with a fear of phone slipping out of hands a better option is go for a flip cover which gives you more confidence and protects the phone from scratches and shocks  thumbs up to amazonin for their commitment to serve the customer i booked the phone first on flipkart at around 9pm from office but due to some difficulties in payment mode i thought of doing it from home later in the night to my surprise the cost of the phone increased by rs 900 in the next one hour and i didnt had the option but to go for amazon to my surprise amazon though i booked the phone at 1145pm in the night the phone was made available at my office next day by 5pm
3140	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	the phone is awesome  1 great batter of 3400 mah 2 gives a great visibility in reading ebooks 3 lifetime msoffice 4 free upgradable to windows 81 5 playing games experience  great 6 watching videomovies great 7 camera quality is  good but could have been better  as a package its a great phone
3141	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	gets heated up navigation app problem  i guess due to non updated apps battery life is not so great as expected
3142	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	amazon delivered the product within four days and i appreciate the service of amazon the manufacturing date shown on the box is august 2014 the os loaded is windows 81the product was dispatched by eswar enterprises  bangalore i used the phone just five days  suddenly the phone lost its display and i took it to the  nokia service center 34kozhikode34 the people in the service center told me that the  display panel has got problem  and they would take 30 to 45 days to repair and return the phone i dont know when i am going to get the phone back i am  disappointed with the nokia 1320 phone and the service of nokia authorized service center
3143	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	this is my first product review i ordered this phone while the icici bank discount offer was available i got this phone at rs 13500 plus i am suppose to get a cash back of rs 1500 so final purchase will of of rs 12000 now coming to the phone its a beautiful piece the phone is fast plays games very well battery is excellent windows 81 is too good i dont like android at all so over all i am satisfied with phone performance screen is very large you can read documents very easily i would recommend this phone to all who are looking for a large screen good software and battery backup nokia brand will always be alive
3144	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	bought it from another vendor not from amazonin  regarding the phablet  simple not to many controls like android dont consider this as a complaint i was really fed up of managing a small device with too many controls and feels super slow once the applications are loaded so used to reset it every 6 months cant comment on performance of lumia but from my known acquaintances windows phone does not have such problems  ui is fresh and easy to navigate not a palm top computer like any samsung note  no theme concept in lumia other than coloring trendy  touch is responsive at least 10 better than android  widgets are just icons to the actual control page 60 this actually not a good idea  missing my htc desire optical track ball  was really an added advantage while typing  speaker ear piece hole just on the edge bit uncomfortable for long duration calls voice clarity is natural and brilliant volume is little lower side  for me it is a phone ebook reader a hand held device with better usability  about battery its simply awesome lasting for 23 days with medium usage only edge connection checked so far because it is enough for my need  quite sure on hsdpa networks this will last anything more than 15 days 0  100 charging in 25hrs  screen display imo what else we could expect from such a small device it is hd display 245ppi not able to identify any pixels  camera if somebody wants to replace their handy cam or dslr this is not for them but enough for occasional scene capture  design slim a case is recommend for more grip because it is a 634 phone plastic looks bit cheap quality but it is nokia  storage this is important out of 8gb internal memory 25 already allocated for os  and 15 for other applications so totally it was close to 4gb remaining when i got the phone  music this is another incredible feature in lumia 1320 just one word awesome use a sony or sennheiser headphone  data supports edge and hsdpa but not lte
3145	Nokia Lumia 1320 (Black)	the phablet is really cool it works really smoothly touch is awesome some applications r less compared to android but still the phone rocks good battery back up display but camera could have been better still loving it

3180	Panasonic Eluga L 4G- Radiant Blue	i bout this handset from a shop a week ago and i am just satisfied with it i must say that i was attracted by the style and the  weight the style is awesome and it is light weighted the configuration is okay but it could be improved ram is just 1 gb it could be even more processor is 12 ghz quadcore snap dragon system is working good and running smooth battery is just 2000 mah and it could be made 2500 or 3000  camera is good both main and front facing camera are awesome pictures are with clear and there is no lag between camera and gallery but i could not find the preinstalled music player typing is also not upto the mark i feel the touch sensitivity is less for this set else the set is fine and no hanging or restarting issues so far

3194	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Neo N750 (White)	i have bought this item for 26299 inr and its a beast in specs 1 note 3 neo has 8 mp camera but it produces excellent pictures and they are far far better and good looking than other branded cameras and we can say that its the 2nd best ever made 8mp camera anyhow 1st is apples camerain 8 mp series 34its not about the camera pixels but about that software that process the camera matters  samsung has great camera software34 2 this phone gave me 32000 antutu benchmark rating i think its one of the best scores 3 spen is a great feature most of the people say there is no use of spen its time taking process to use spen but in my opinion spen is great feature and i always want somthing special in my phone which is this spen it brings back the feel of writing ur messages than typing them excellent feature by samsung 4 display i heard in many reviews that sgn3neo does not have gorilla glass protection but its wrong this mobile comes with gorilla glass 2 dont worry if u want extra  protection buy a tampered glass screen protector and its very easy to install i installed my first screen protector in my life ant thats without any air gap or dust particles   the screen is around 270 pixel per inch and remember it is a 55 inch phone so u will get totally a large number of pixels to see 5 battery life 3100 mah battery will go 15  2 days for 1 full charge and remember unlike lgg2sg s4  htc one e8 or m8 this has less ppi value be4 mentioned have more than 400ppi less ppi means less battery consumption so it can run days for 1 charge 6 samsung gives good warranty service and charges also pretty less  and its time about cons 1 i bought the black version but the charger and earphones still are white i saw many unboxing videos but in all i observed the same its little little odd to have white charger for a black mobile no issues with white version same white charger and earphones are provided 2 the display is good and one handed operation is possible but we cannot reach the side capacitive buttons with one hand anyhow samsung provided a solution giving one handed operation application which allows you to reduce ur display to smaller area thats it about cons   close competitors and their disadvantages according to sgn3neo 1 best competitor is sg s4   pros with cons great ppi 441 and hence more battery consuming   slim and handy but sgn3 neo is slim but not handy but we have got spen to  beat sg s4   true advantage is 13 mp back camera excellent pics as its from samsung  2 lg g2   again more ppi not need fr human eye and its battery eater too   13 mp camera but i dont think think this takes better pics than sgn3neo due to average camera software non removable battery fr lg g2 and no memory slot too true advantage is ois feature in camera will take little less effort in take picture knock on feature is pretty useful but again it consumes more battery  3 htc one e8   more ppi more battery consumption and again non removable battery and no external memory card slot  one main draw back is htc unibody design its very difficult to replace screen when it cracks its costs around 15k and u have to say good bye to ur phone for 1 month as it needs be fixed accurately and perfectly and so it will be sent to tiwan or us etc  advantage good camera build quality and mainly boom surround and beats audio are excellent very handy good looks  if u are sure that u can handle ur phone very carefully without damaging the screen u can go for it and its 10k more too  i an not even considering micromax xolo karbon and all local brands as they are not upto these mobiles  all the above mentioned close competitors will cost more than sgn3 neo  finally its upto the user requirements to choose a mobile sgn3neo satisfied my requirements and hope this will satisfy urs too hurry and grab it be4 samsung decides again to increase its price  d p

3215	Xolo A500 Club (Black)	there is no pic of the black phone online you can see a video at   i purchased this phone in stunning black from another marketplace  got it delivered on february 15 from design  hardware perspective this phone is a class leader at its price in most aspects but xolo has ruined the android experience  design  hardware pros  overall the phone feels to be of a much higher price range  zero panel gaps brilliant non joint smooth metal casing between front  rear panels  stunning chrome finish embossing of the logo on the rear premium colour finishing of the front  rear panels  only phone at this budget with dual sim 3g support which is not even found in sony xperia c or moto g feature not mentioned in actual specifications found in the network settings on the phone  clever integration of earpiecetop  micbottom with dual front speakers closing hard to clean large dust accumulation locations  better camera  bright led  led compared with a500s illuminates well at about 3m as a functional emergency torch in case of a night power outage compared with a500s a shot in pitch dark interiors does a fair capture  design  hardware cons  some slight niggles  confusing fragile sim 1 mini sim 2 micro  micro sd slots integrated together without a push to release option making it hard to release sim cards  no magnetometer which is needed for navigation generally not found in this price range xolo missed an ace  no back lighting of hard touch buttons  xolo has fudged up with the stock android build of a500s version 422 in a very disgusting manner for this phone copying samsung and indirectly apple interface the settings screen is all messed up  if you are used to stock android  never used crap samsung interface then you will feel miserable it could easily run stock android 431 giving xolo another ace at this price point but instead they have goofed up by doing useless customizations  software cons  no software pros it is so bad  removed option to disable incoming calls from contacts you want to block forced to install an app for this  cant use google now voice calling as there is no way to choose a default sim out of the two sims  thus each time you use google now to calltext eventually you will have to use touch again to choose the sim to use  cant remove multiple calls or messages threads simultaneously you have to delete each separately or delete all no option to do multi select like stock android  cant see multiple numbers of a contact when using t9 smart typing to find name only first number is callableyou have to go to contacts listing to choose other numbers as mentioned in the next point even that is screwed  if you use custom contacts display option from android the xolo customizations are a bummer i like to keep only a few contacts displayable for whatsapp on my phone as i dont want to cram my whatsapp list with the large amount of numbers i have you can still choose custom contacts listing from different accounts but what happens is that now when you want to call one of the non displayed google contacts with multiple phone numbers as mentioned above they are not searchable by typing any more so you have to enable them for listing just for that brief period of time you want to call them infrequently  removed roaming indicator from notification bar thus leading to confusion with sim identification i use 2 vodafone connections from 2 different states xolo has removed the option to rename or color code the sims present in stock android instead adding a tiny icon to identify the sim for the incoming call the sim cards just register with the name of the service provider by default  that cant be changed  data usage monitor has been completely removed navigation bar data usage indicator is no longer linked to the active data sim this leads to major confusion when you want to use the nifty 3g switching feature as you have to double check the data sim being used with no direct indicator  the xolo power app just reads the defaults the android interface in settings already provides which have been disabled from there  repackaged as bloatware xolo has removed the option to see simple things like battery  on navigation bar itself  instead the app has to be fired up to see the exact battery level each time  xolo has ruined the basic phone features of dual sim callsms completely these can possibly be recuperated by installing additional apps but then why would you want to drain your battery with those overall because of the immensely superior design  hardware at such a low price range i would still give the phone a 35 for a pathetic software bloat
3216	Xolo A500 Club (Black)	this phone is available in market at a price rs6500 i have been using this phone over a month the phone has equivalent performance as xolo a500s ips pros  1 great touch 2 you can play games like subway surf temple run 8ball pool candy crush etc without any lags 3 amazing performance with skype 3g calling 4 xolo secure is quite helpful software as it helpds in backing up phone and protects against theft 5 it has hidden cleaning software which you can open by holding the back button and press clean task so avoids installation of addidtional 3rd party software for this purpose 6 speaker sound is simply great 7 camera quality is good with quite useful software features  cons  1 battery backup is less as compared to xolo a500s ips 2 device slightly heats up while playing games 3 poor camera performance  verdict  better go for redmi 1s lenovo a6000  honor holly or moto e much better performance and specs in this price 
3217	Xolo A500 Club (Black)	the mobile is good and it is working very well the response of the processor and ram is amazing i could play most of the games and it has no too much of lag and works fine the thinness of the mobile is attractive and most of my friends fell in love with the mobile the most disadvantage is the xolo headset which is not good so i use skullcandy people who have 5 or 6k in hand and looking for a good mobile then please go for this one the best one for a low price   
3218	Xolo A500 Club (Black)	good lookingweight lesswit advanced featuresbut its camera quality is very poorboth front and backnot like 5mplooks like vj camerabetter go for branded ones by investing few hundreds more

3223	Xolo A500 Club (Black)	no complaints what so ever for the price and for the features mentioned its great i bought this phone for my mother but i end up using it longer so what if it isnt a huge brand it is worth beyond what you pay for it way beyond what you pay micromax turbo and this work the same

3225	Xolo A500 Club (Black)	the processor speed the competitive pricing is good as compared to the comparative market of micromax samsung but the camera quality is not good even being a 5 mp camera a 2 mp camera of samsung  13 mp camera of sony ericsson is better than that of this
3226	Xolo A500 Club (Black)	thanks for the product only problem is battery does not last long
3227	Xolo A500 Club (Black)	if somebody asks me to rate xolo on a 05 scale sorry to say i would rate it a 0  i regret the day i decided to buy xolo  in fact i had gone to the showroom to buy a samsung brand i have been using for the last 2 decades and got so carried away by the sales executive of a local xolo dealer that i decided to for a change buy a xolo  i was super excited when i saw an offer on amazon for xolo club 500 and went ahead and placed an order for the phone  the phone looked impressive  but 15 days after the purchase i started having problems with  the power and one day it went dead  i took it to the service center in trivandrum kerala and was told there is a problem with the battery but will have to wait for another 10 days to get it replaced since the service center in trivandrum is not yet officially opened they have just signed a contract with xolo  which means i have been able to use the phone only for 15 days purchasing the xolo club 500 has been more than a headache for me and never will i ever recommend a xolo to any of my friends or family i am now seriously thinking of going to the consumer court
3228	Xolo A500 Club (Black)	i took mobile one month before the mobile asks to update it we say yes na  u can bad features like bad camera qualityslow applicationslow battery worst music quality and so many kinldy iam suggesting u not to purchase this mobile after giving service also same service

3254	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	i bought this phone almost 2 weeks back here is my detailed review warning amazon doesnt segregate the white color with glossy and matte they dont know about it they know only one finishing which is white yes it is funny the phone amazon is selling has no matte finish back panel they dont have matte finish models and they dont talk about it in details which is confusing and misleading if you are ok with glossy do not hesitate to buy this phone  1the is monster battery phone 57 in your hand looks huge and the finish is way better than any micromax or any other chinese brand phone 2 the screen resolution is not full hd but still it is clear and clean the default color scheme looks beautiful you can change the color tone in the settings with your own choice so this is brilliant step by microsoft 3 the camera i think this is pone of the best camera phone in this price rangethe back camera is 13 mp but it surely looks way better than any other 13 mp camera phones the pictures are way better than any other 13 mp android phones you actually can use shutter speed if you have steady hands you will get brilliant pictures in darkness if you want the phone for best camera go ahead for this beast the camera app lumia camera is beautiful with advances settings and basic settings for normal user 4 the finishing phone looks premium and rich the back panel is beautiful white color looks premium i am android lover but tgis phone surely changed my viewes about windows phones 5 this phones battery is beast if you arre moderate phopne user and yoy dont play games the battery will last as long as 3 days yes 3 days if you watch videos surf net on wifi it goes 2 days for sure this battery is real beast nbo android phone will last long as much as tis phone 6 brand people are running crazy for chinese brands this brand is trustworthy for indiand more than 2 decades it is microsoft so if they launch something they will take care of the trust 7 cash back the inbuilt app mobiqwik gives you 200 rs cashback every month for next 5 months this is simply brilliant please googlr for this offer or go through microsoft site 8 soon it will have windows 10 and it will be more faster and speedy 9 small but crystal clear speakers  1 this is huge phone so it is sometimes not easy to handle you will get finger ache if you hold this phone for longer than 10 mins 2 less apps compared to android and ios but soon all andorid apps will be compatible with windows so wait for the good news  if you want a good rich premium phone with great battery and best camera if you dont care for availability of all andorid apps at least for newxt few months stop wasting your time and go for this and i am not windows lover still i found this phone beautiful
3255	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	it was a tough decision first of all to decide whether to buy a windows phone or stick to an android but as i wanted a change since i used an android phone for 2 years i decided to buy a windows phone now i had two options either buy nokia lumia 730 or wait for 3 months and go for lumia 640 xl i liked smaller one earlier and had almost decided for buying it but due to exams the purchase was postponed now with 1 month before getting released and exams over i decided to research a little regarding the bigger one at first with only raw specs available i disliked it but soon when it started to get limelight my opinion reversed now with lumia 640 xl in my hands here is the actual review and opinion  640 xl is big compared to other phones but i dont think it should be categorised as a phablet it fits in my hand it doesnt at all feel bulky and looks classic it may look overweighed in specs column but take it in hand and you will feel a big difference it isnt at all heavy actually it feels light and perfect to hold build quality is satisfactory and corning gorilla glass is indestructible not actually shaan haider has put a good video showcasing the knife test on its screen he murdered it p  performance is flawless screen is beautiful build quality is perfect size isnt an issue value for money camera is best among its competetors battery backup is massive long lasting  if still any queries then ask me im here
3256	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	i dont know why people criticise microsoft everytimethis phone is far better in performancebattery lifecamera than any phone at this price please dont go through people personal review for microsoft and please dont post itjust post about phone
3257	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	the phone looks elegant white one with the clear black display  amazon sells the phone with glossy back cover kindly aware of that before ordering glossy is ok but i excepted that to be a matte finish  windows 81 works fluidic no lag even in multitasking i got the phone for rupees 13495  pros 1 battery will surely last for an day on intense usage3ggaming and can last for one and half day with moderate usage 2 big clear display although the ppi 256 the text and image are in good claritywhite appears as clear white 3 lumia camera is excellent in outdoor condition and was averageok in indoor artificial lighting conditions 4 cortana works well but we have too be so clear in pronunciation 5 double tap wake and sleep works well 6social networking sites works flawlessly no issue on that 7 front camera works well wide angle lens covers large areagood for group selfies 8 although the phone looks big feel light in hand 9 one drive and windows sync works good 10 no heating issues cons 1 the phone is big 2 the loudspeaker is not that great but ok u are not gonna  play songs in loudspeaker 3 charging cable cant be used for data sync with pc no usb cable provided 4 same old nokia headset with microsoft brand on it  verdict if your are ok with big display and windows os than this is a phone for you with a great build quality
3258	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	its heavy for holding in hand and cannot be used without a good flipcover however hardware is good and battery is reasonable biggest drawback is it takes around 35 hours to get fully charged which is really embarassing game and browsing performance is satisfactory
3259	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	what a phone i bought this offamazon and it is a beast better than lumia 1320 in every way you get removable battery replaceable shells latest windows 13 mp rear camera and 5mp front camera which is similar to my lumia 535 in many ways
3260	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	meets expectation and a great value for money have problems in activating office 365 could be a permanent licence rather than for one year only minimum on board memory be extended to 16gb

3264	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	i have buy this phone recently from ebay at rs15499 i am always buying  products  from amazon  but this time phone price value is very high on amazonabout the phone 640 xl is superb  touches are very good lumia camera 128247  taking  good snap shot5734 display is very good 128522  and  comfortable in one hand i have used this phone last 3 days no any issue foundasphalt 8 game 127918is working good one day battery  back up is disappointed otherwise good phone
3265	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	have been using windows mobile for the past 2 yearsfirst lumia 720 and now lumia 630 i think they were priced appropriately to their android counterparts at that time but now microsofts pricing of l640xl and her younger sibling is little higher than the devices of other brands in spite of its 13 mp zeiss or otherwise higher end hardware they claim to use
3266	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	greetings prospective buyers  i have this phone and this is my third purchase in lumia series after 720 and 730 in that order please do not be led astray into not buying or say being discouraged from buying simply because you see it as not in receipt of those stellar over and above 4 star ratings which 730 had earned it is a great phone and a slight improvement in terms of touch feel and build quality over lumia 730 and if you liked 730 and remember having reviewed it favorably you wont be remiss in enjoying and admiring your purchase of 640 xl simply put there are no marked distinctions between 730 and 640 xl except for camera and screen size the back panel on white color is not glossy and has a premium touch and feel to it which for me is a great improvement battery is replaceable and so is the panel i am not aware of any marked improvements or variegation in the software department over what 730 had to offer  on a side note this phone can be sourced at a price of about 14000 from other portals and that amazon is unable to make it available for that or even remotely competitive a price may be a bit of put down the only reason i am not giving it a five star rating is because it is a difficult behavior for me
3267	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	yes good but ony 5 mini ofter heat 60 why this problem pls tel me sir
3268	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, White)	great phone great cameras both front and main good features fine design fresh os go for it the cost of this device at the launch in india was 15799 you guys are selling it for 16599 are you kidding me amazon and excelentp

3274	Micromax Canvas Selfie A255 (White)	as the name describes  the photos are just amazing even the low light performance in comparison to the price is just great and in terms of looks its pretty awesome  the only drawback is that it gets a little hot while using it and nothing  else
3275	Micromax Canvas Selfie A255 (White)	i have always been an htc user this was a 1st time switch its a beautiful phone its stylish full metal body which only phones above 25k has super slim light weight amazing battery life 810 hrs with continuous use  the back camera is gorgeous that catches attention where strangers have asked me the the phone name also the pic quality is just amazing this phone is a star at my officewhere for every occasion my phone is called for thats actually annoying  overall i couldnt have asked for a better phone than this  also the earlier post have mentioned heating of the device whereas i have never faced it there is an inbuild app called clean master which shows the phone lag and heat statusif u just refresh it the phone is optimized the charging also takes just 45 min for full battery charge i find that very good so anyone who is thinking about this phone definitely go for it its worth it

3279	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	i bought this on friday for around 8 k from a local mobile store i have 2 tablets and 3 smartphones so i feell myself fairly competent for a review  regarding the phone 1as all said its 13ghz processor 21gb ram rocks with the speed 3camera is ok not upto the mark  4jellybean runs awesome in this configuration 5regarding the screen it looks like my  tab   the screen is too big though its 5 looks more bigger  due to thin bezels 6battery backup the main thing to concentrate believe me it came with 3000mah battery the backup it very very good then compared to any other mobiles easily lasts 2 days 7 the newly installed from the micromax  wotcha a lot watch movies etcc  what can we expect more in a 65k phone  go for tit guys its awesome you will really feel an awesome experience  finally please hit like button if you found this review helpful 
3280	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	my main criteria was 534 screen and powerful battery since all other features will be there by default in a smartphone and thats why shortlisted for a177 but my bad luck i received a defective piece the phone was struggling to clamp to the network tried with different sims in both the slot but hardly got any signal my friends were complaining about the clarity of my voice during the call since  the basic functionality not working properly i returned the device  on 30th oct   meanwhile tested the other featureswifi bluetooth gps etc and all working fine the camera is decent enough atleast i wont complain on that part i was using lumia 520 and a177 pics daylight are almost on its par   i was amazed by its battery life it stood strong for almost 15 day with a single  charge i used wifi for 12 hrs 3g for 4 hrs listened to music watched videos used maps emails camera   initially i was skeptical to buy micromax but nevertheless i felt this is a good phone and so i again ordered for another a177 will receive it today and im pretty much sure that i wont be unlucky 2nd time  amazon policy are really customer centric hats off giving 4 star
3281	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	bought this for my wife as a surprise after her phone got stolen and she really liked this amazon delivered this within a single day all the way from mum to blr with 2 day dlvry option and left my wife pleasantly shocked at the speed  pros  1 best part is the huge capacity battery that lasts 3 days for moderate usage and more than a day for heavy usage this would be good for my wife as her work involves lots of phone calls and she frequently complains out of charge 2 the screen looks really big on this as the surrounding bezel is relatively thinner 3 jelly bean os and this 13 ghz duo processor really appear to like hand in glove in this model 4 sound quality is quite good and phone reception looks decent on airtel  bangalore both gsm and cdma networks supported 5 has all the jingles like bluetooth wifi and fm radio 6 decent back camera  cons  1 wifi doesnt support 5ghz radio and only supports 24ghz but this is only a minor issue 2 the front camera quality is quite bad and even back camera quality is just ok
3282	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	i ordered this phone on 7th oct and it was in my hand on 9th oct amazon service is really very speedy  box was properly packed and it was brand new with all the accessories i inserted my sim and started to check its features all features like bluetooth wifi charging were working properly but suddenly while checking i noticed that there was no network in my phone i went out of home and network appeared i get full signal in my other phones so i was bit worried about this i inserted another sim and same situation no network i tried different variation like inserted sim from first slot to another add two different sims in two slots etc but no change in signal after doing some rd i found that phone was not picking signal in any building only in open air i was getting full signal even that was also dropping abruptly so i decided to return as it was not serving my purpose of calling from home  besides this phone is really nice if you hold it in your hand you feel like you are holding 15000 rs phone camera quality is average but if you increase white setting in it pics look better sound through hands free is average  on 12th oct amazon representative picked up phone from my home and on 13th i got money in my bank account again amazon keeps its reputation  i will not blame seller for this may be this piece was not good but otherwise in 5k range this phone is really good
3283	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	i am writing this review after one weeks usage of this phone bought this model after considering the reviews of other mobile phones from amazon  i was bit confused to buy micromax unite but finally decided to buy this because of the 3000mah battery this is really a lottery win 1gb ram dual sim 4gb internal memory 32gb expandable memory android jelly bean and all the more 3000mah battery good speakers with high definiiton video and audio i can listen to music and youtube videos through the speaker just like as in an led tv no lagging no heating good touch sensitivity big screen so many inbuilt applications high end specifications the only defect is poor camera quality but i did not buy this camera for becoming a professional photographer  the camera quality is enough to serve the purpose it is really a bargain to get this phone for just 4500 on offer from amazon shipped very fast good packaging i would really recommend this to all initially i found the phone too big to handle but it is slim and light weight
3284	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	very nice phone at this budgetcamera is awesome in daylight but at night its horrible but acceptable as the phone performs its task beautifullyinterface looks goodhow can one left its battery backup its huge 3000 mah battery gives long backup as most of smartphone lack at this pointmy phone start rebooting itself after 15 days of use so i am replacing it otherwise the phone is awesome go for itthanks to amazon for their all support
3285	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	micromax canvas juice a177 is a good  phone for those who are looking for a low budget smartphone phone  the price range of this phone is low and to get this phone in 5k is really a good opportunity  merits of this phone  1touch is awesome at this price range  2plays 720p  videos without any lags and also the games ie subway surfer  temple run 3music playback is not bad 4daylight camera is ok but not at night as camera quality was not my concern 5screen size was my requirement bcoz 534 screen is a problem to handle for some people  demerits of this phone  1battery is not at my expectation although it has 3000 mah capacity 2sound is low incoming call ring 3some hd games may lag as i am not  addicted of playing games 4i have installed apps and moved to sd card and still it is showing low memory  for those who are looking for a low budget phone they can go for micromax canvas juice a177

3288	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	about amazon delivery i ordered for one day delivery paying 99rs but got it only on the second day evening  coming to the product its worth for money and ordered it after many comparisons you cant even imagine such a spec for this price the battery life is awesome and it stands for more than 15 days with 3g on another good thing is you wont feel any heat even on continuous use processing is fast and worth big screen treat for gamers and movie watchers camera is good but not excellent it has only basic options
3289	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	i bought this mobile 3 months ago on oct714 and i see some problems in this mobile internal memory is too low camera was not good but overall the mobile is better then any other mobiles in this price
3290	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	well i had ordered this for my dad and thanks to the amazon it was a very sweet deal i wanted a normal budget starting range phone with big screen hell of a battery and normal camera and i guess this phone fits the bill perfectly till date this would have been first dads first smart phone so specs doesnt matter to him much i just wanted him to learn android and we know android needs powerful battery they tested other functions and it was working perfectly fine within 5k there was no better deal then this one i gave a thought to reorder this phone from some other retailer but then saw the deal for lumia 625 and ordered 2 phones through amazon its just that i was unfortunate and received a bad lemon there was some glitch with the camera and we were getting distorted image one of my colleague has this phone and it works pretty fine as per the price tag it was my first micromax product and had to return it i would like to add here that amazon should switch to replace the product policy rather then simply refunding the money just like their big competitor doesthey should refund if the customer asks for it or if the second piece is also bad we returned the product and in due process my retired parents felt discomfort as there is no pickup policy for my area they had to pack and send it through india post which totally beats the purpose as i order things online for my parents comfort  last thing  amazons own delivery is superb no doubt about it but this product was delivered by india post it took 10 days within haryana to deliver it from mewat 62 gurgaon 62 faridabad india post totally match to its reputation and sucks they sent the delivered acknowledgement in the afternoon but actually delivered the product in the evening and we all know why for the tip they ask for with every mailparceldelivery they do
3291	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	i received the mobile well before estimate time2days before overall features are excellentcamera is of good quality also good speed due to 1gb ram internal storage capacity is lessok no issue with this pricecan be increased by sd card smooth touch and operation sound quality is also good screen size great really it is excellent choice in this price range thanks to micromax
3292	Micromax Canvas Juice A177 (Black)	a beautiful phone  works as advertised  has jelly bean instead of the horrible kitkat dont know new android versions are stripping the goodies one by one 442 does not repeat mail alerts only rings once  bought one for my uncle and for myself  good battery  lasts with heavy usage for 24 hours  audio is clear  photos are nothing much but i bought a phone not a camera signal reception is excellent  display is excellent  only do not try to put hd pics as wall paper it will pixelate badly  would recommend this phone for anyone with email and call as priority

3299	BlackBerry Curve 9320 (Black)	1 year usage review excellent phone for the price bracket cons battery problem that all blackberry users seem to be having frequent auto reboot once the battery  falls below the 5060 life this will frustrate you beyond your imagination and particularly when you need it the most urgent call show a ticket to train tte or airline security get directions
3300	BlackBerry Curve 9320 (Black)	bb curve is a fitting business phone  outstanding from the bulk of smart phones with its excellent keyboard easy handling and useful software im happy to have it

3305	BlackBerry Curve 9320 (Black)	awsome
3306	BlackBerry Curve 9320 (Black)	needs too much extra effort to run and does not have much support needs special internet packs and does not justify the cost i had to return it
3307	BlackBerry Curve 9320 (Black)	the charger does not work i am using my old charger the battery does notlast the day not half as much asd my old curve this is my first online purchase and i have no clue how to handle the problem
3308	Lenovo A859 (White)	i love this phone as it is having 8gb internal memory and expandable upto 32 gb which is primary plus point of this phone next thing is hd display which gives unmatched experience while watching movies even 1080p and the microphone and loudspeaker are the another assets for this phone i feel like day by day some new features are being added  only negative thing about this phone is that it is having very delicate back panel and sim slots are not firm apart from this every thing is perfect in this phone
3309	Lenovo A859 (White)	lenovo is setting a benchmark for its competitors i have been using this phone for almost for a month now till date didnt face any trouble it has a very sleek and stylish look camera quality is superb touch is also great the only thing i dont like about this phone is the earphone very poor quality and make sure you use a scratch guard even though lenovo boasts of scratchresistant screen mine got a small scratch recently besides that its a nice low budget phone totally worth buying trust me you8217ll love it
3310	Lenovo A859 (White)	worth for 8kso far happy with the performance48 hours of usagebattery charge will remain for 12 hours with moderate usagetouch response and screen clarity is goodits way superior to other sub 10k handsetsvery much disappointed with the headset it will not fit in so im using a different brand headseti dont understand why lenovo is providing such unfit accessories still im happywill update the further details shortlyhats off to amazon
3311	Lenovo A859 (White)	the phone is awesome i wonder why people are picking micromax and all lenovo is equally competent in all aspects to leading brands
3312	Lenovo A859 (White)	it is only few months since the phone was purchased and it is already having problemthe microphone  does not work lenovo service center in kochi is not having spare and it is more than a week we are waitingand service center is not confirming when spare will comelenovo should be taking care
3313	Lenovo A859 (White)	hello guy  one of the best mobile in this priceu can say worthy  im impressed wth dis configuration  just buy
3314	Lenovo A859 (White)	its been 15 days iam using the phone  overall iam very happy for the money i paid towards it touch charge performance  camera  sound quality the only hitch i have towards using the phone is when picking the call it stays hanged at times may be because of very sensitive touch screen  also may be because of multi command swipe notification been taking by the phone while pulling the call
3315	Lenovo A859 (White)	bought it for rs 9800 and i think it is totally value for money good battery life good camera good phone overall
3316	Lenovo A859 (White)	things i liked 1gb ram mobile with 5 inch screen and a good camera mobile sleek and modern design with removable battery and dual normal sim good resolution havnt tested any gaming as i limit it to pcs only  i think going beyond these needs is just a waste in terms of mobiles and just shows off ones luxury
3317	Lenovo A859 (White)	awesome mob i am totally satisfied with it the touch sensor is really good am camera results also
3318	Lenovo A859 (White)	excellent product by lenovo at an affordable price very much satisfied with the product
3319	Lenovo A859 (White)	this not a good phone and lag the features which are important  downloading more then a limit of apps just makes it slow so my suggestion would be that you should prefer any other phone of same brand rather than this dilivery facility is also not good it makes one waiting for new phone to come
3320	Lenovo A859 (White)	the products  goodthe features and the processor speed was pretty goodgood mobile to click pictures and has a good internal storage of 8gbcam was awesomeearphones doesnt last more than 3 monthsthe other draw back is the battery which doesnt give the back up as expected after some 4 months
3321	Lenovo A859 (White)	worthless phone os cant be upgraded to kitkat whole software contains problem sometime download happening sometime not battery performance is also not satisfactory purchased and now returning although amazon support is quite complimentary now im confused about lenovo mobiles
3322	Lenovo A859 (White)	good phone received in time with good packing overall performance is  exellent
3323	Lenovo A859 (White)	its the best phone in the market with superrb camera build quality battery performance and mainly with the best brand thanks amazon and thanks to the lenovo team i love it
3324	Lenovo A859 (White)	this is a amazing phone in this priceits apps are too good and its processor alsoand no chance of hangbattery backup is superbso guys dont miss this chance u should get it
3325	Lenovo A859 (White)	good in use but back cover is sophisticated amazon will provide only 10 day return facility  after 10 days my power key nt work nt known what is future of my money 
3326	Lenovo A859 (White)	excellent product for the cost i love lenovo products they are worth the cost especially my smart phone i m loving it
3327	Lenovo A859 (White)	the video taken using the phone seems to be stretched is their any settings to make it normal  every thing else is fine
3328	Micromax Bolt A065 (White )	this is a 3g mobile 
3329	Micromax Bolt A065 (White )	good
3330	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Jet Black)	no i did not buy this on amazonin  i took a very long time to make the decision and when i finally decided on the note i wasnt sure of which one the latest one offered lte which seems to be on the anvil and a ginormous display resolution there were other key improvements like yhe pressure sensitivity of the tablet camera fingerprint sensor etc which did not matter to me as much as the 20k savings  hence with careful costbenefit analysis i decided on the note3 and at the same time invested in original flip cover as well as otg cable once i switched it on i was at peace given its astounding resolution deep blacks super amoleds rock and handful of applications all oriented towards someone like memore work and serious stuff than games and chatting  this is a middle aged mans phone it has everything i wanted to do things quick and more together with the tab s i have an unbeatable pair of devices that just work fantastic look gorgeous and are marvels of software technology in their own rights
3331	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Jet Black)	i am a user of a galaxy note 3 that is 15 years old i am a very heavy user who does a lot of calls and have whopping 29 gmail accounts push always on whatsapp skype running at all times and this phone is the only one that lasts mr through the day  after an year the battery got weak but i easily changed it at home as it is user replaceable  ah the joy of having a phone with removable battery  take that apple phones who charge 78k for replacing battery i got mine from amazon for under 1500 directly from samsung  this is a rock solid phone and none of its parts will fail  just make sure not to use it roughly and always have a metal bumper case around its sides  the bumper case will serve two purposes 1st it will make your phone look cool i got silver one for my black note 3 and elegant second it prevents the chrome from getting damaged  verdict  this is the best phone on the market till now that does not compromise on performance and battery life
3332	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Jet Black)	im rating this drvice after a long use the device is good from specs but as you know that the samsung devices laggs too much i was using the device from a long time and when i bought it it works perfectly for the couple of weeks but after a month later the device starts lagging too much which is not good for any consumer the camera quality is really very impressive but it gets dull in low light the device comes with 3gb of ram but still it laggs i have rated it 3 stars according to its specs and i must suggest to you that dont go for it the device will completely disappoint you
3333	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Jet Black)	note samsung gets 0 stars the phone gets 5 stars even 6  the note 3 is awesome but customers should be upset over the simm lock on it and not get this n9000 model the n9005 or a carrier model is the only way to go  this international version is not for us users or even us users who travel if you are not a traveler forget the comments about it being region locked  i still say 999 of all people who get the note 3 could not care less if the international version is region locked however this model if you expect to use it in other countries has resulted in a thousand problems literally the phone is neutral but when it is activated the simm locks in the region and you cannot use it elsewhere do not think 34unlocked34 means you have magical usage there is no universal phone except for spies although some phones use other country simm cards  but not this one i get a us carrier phone travel internationally and keep my phone in airplane mode and use wifi or get a phone card  get the scoop do a search for xdadevelopers dot com and go to the site this is where the big boys and girls hang for programming not dumb questions type in galaxy note 3 in the field for the phone you desire in the forums go to galaxy note 3 general search down the page to the thread 34simm restrictions on unlocked european note 334 this thread has over 1300 posts yes this is a big problem read the first half dozen pages and the last 10 pages but also check especially posts 1041 through 1045 and pages 117 and 18  this n9000 phone is the international or european version it was released 23 weeks prior to the us versions it is not lte it is 3g it has a different cpu the samsung exynos 5 processor not the qualcom snapdragon 800 us residents should not get it we need to get a phone activated for our respective carriers which changes the last digit of the number search amazon for the note 3 for your carrier notice the different last digit  amazon may be confusing people by not listing the phone for what it really is and they need to change that in the title of the phone the black version does say international34 in the title and so should the white one  now down to business  first i am not affiliated with samsung in any way nor do i work for a cell phone store i am a writer though secondly i hate long reviews where the poster just reports the specs you already have rather these comments show why the galaxy note 3 is more technologically advanced and more phone for your money compared to the many good phones on the market today and the not so good phones like the cave phone thats what i call it that does nothing  1 the beautiful 5734 super amoled hd display has a 34wow34 factor everything is crisp and clear with a resolution of 1920 x 1080p 386 ppi despite a few good contenders no phone on the market can match the combination of vibrant color and deep blacks check it out for yourself for those who prefer drab you can even adjust color intensity and contrast is this practical you bet you get more viewable data for all social networking apps you can see more email and contacts without scrolling browsing is quick and pages more visible youtubes and video are fantastic games are more playable you can see larger areas on gps maps you get a better view of radar in weather live wallpapers look great you can use it as a reader you can multitask with it and with the right productivity apps you can even get some work done on it i will never go back to a small screen phone  2 the cpu in the us versions is the quad core qualcomm snapdragon 800  23 which is the fastest processor on the planet as of this time it will perform well for years to come a few other phones have it the international version uses the samsung exynos 5 processor it also has another quad core processors making it octa core but it is still not quite as fast as the snapdragon  3 the adreno 330 gpu is the best on the market a few other phones have it it is 50 faster than the adreno 320 in the galaxy s4 which is a screamer  4 its the only phone to come with 3 gb of ddr 3 ram it also comes standard with 32 gigs of storage and you can add more with an sd card note no extra charges for these  5 it has a great 13 megapixel camera with useful software a bsi sensor smart digital stabilization and high cri led very few phones have this it is also the only phone to do 4k video right now  sharp  6 no other phone has usb 30 2 advantages the phone charges very quickly on the 2 amp charger and nice thick cable file transfer times are faster with usb 30 a 2 gig file takes 27 seconds from the note 3 to my high end pc with usb 20 the same file takes 57 seconds  7 how many phones have an s pen except for email and quick notes i seldom used the s pen on my original galaxy note but the note 3 comes with some useful software making it more functional and the handwriting recognition is scary accurate  8 how many phones have a huge 3200 ma battery it easily lasts all day with moderate to heavy use despite the large screen hardware and software improvements make the 100 ma bump over the note 2 even more significant you can also open the back and change out the battery  unlike some phones  9 it does infrared remote control it also has tvout via mhl av link accelerometer gyro proximity compass barometer temperature humidity and gesture sensor im serious people you get more for your money  10 hello multitasking the fast cpu  gpu extra memory and highresolution 57 inch screen make multitasking feasible and fun on a cell phone you can even scroll through multiple applications in each split screen this is even better if you hook up a keyboard and mouse via bluetooth or usb and connect through hdmi to your tv or computer monitor the note 3 can actually serve as a small computer how many phones can do that you can also mirror the phone screen with your smart tv for internet games viewing pics whatever  11 this the best cell phone for gaming on the market  period the above features and opengl 30 which is part of android 43 make it happen dont believe me read the reviews watch the you tubes and compared it for yourself  12 it doesnt just have gps it also uses a gps improved and glonass satellites dl a gps satellite app and youll see it will access between 5 and 25 satellites at once depending on time of day and location  13 got knox no you dont this phone provides business enterprise and government level security for boot vpn etc and comes in handy for privacy on public wifi you dont have to use it but it is there  14 the air command and air gesture features make the phone futuristic how many phones do that  15 is the screen too large for one handed operation yes but so what the tradeoff is worth it besides samsung now includes software to shrink it for onehanded so you get the best of both worlds  there are 2 things that samsung needs to improve in my opinion i dont know how many thousands of people need to tell them that putting the volume rockers directly opposite the power button is inconvenient for users the note 2 placement was better but still wrong i do like the new speaker placement though its perfect for horizontal viewing because your hand channels the sound to the user this phone should also be waterproof right outofthebox not a scaleddown version just waterproof the thing other manufacturers are doing it for their flagship phones that means samsung can do it too truth be known we users never want to see another flagship phone that is not waterproof its doable so please do it smoke it with that nanowhatever waterproofing stuff you went to ces oh and s voice is still sorry use google voice  all that said im very very happy with the note 3 imho the note 3 is so powerful and functional it is the first device i would classify as a hand held computer as a professor i researched it for days and used the original galaxy note for over a year now there are other good phones but the note 3 does it in one package and in almost all cases does it better for the same flagship phone price i feel sorry for the fanboys and people believing advertising hype who dont research the market they pay top dollar but dont get their moneys worth amazon is a great place to get your moneys worth and to find out user information thanks amazon  oh yeah almost forgot to mention its a really good phone too

3377	Panasonic T40 (Dark Grey)	good reliable phone in this price range  besides the regular features two features i found useful are these  i normally forget to switch off the phone before going to bed many people will have same problem i believe automatic switch off and switch on feature when enabled with preset time will relieve the owner the burden of remember these tasks i have set automatic switch off at 10pm and i will sleep with peace of mind this feature is really useful because the relatively low capacity battery i dont find any speaker grille on the case or front i think the whole case vibrates when audio is playing and this gives diffused sound instead of directional sound and the sound quality and volume also is good
3378	Panasonic T40 (Dark Grey)	amazingphoneit will fulfil all ur needsits battery back up is awsmcamera is vry goodand price is very lowll in 1best of panasonic

3389	Panasonic T40 (Dark Grey)	android phone with 8gb rom and 1 gb ram but battery capacity is 1500mah funny will it work for only 1 hr if we enable wifi video streaming blue tooth share  3g minimum 2000mah is good
3390	Panasonic T40 (Dark Grey)	you have to mention detail of this phone
3391	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	this is awesome phone when i open the box i shocked this is looking like iphone 5s
3392	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	awesome in mid range phones dual speaker enrich sound high graphic games run smoothly touch response is great camera is decent  cons screen has no protection so better of using a screen guard  best mid range phone so far i am using it since two daysbut not found any cons other than that it every thing is good you will like it whether its camera screen resolution touch sound looks all the things are upto marks  i am fully satisfied with this stylish phone626262626262
3393	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	excellent device for this price very sturdy good battery life good camera in day light not so good in dark but over all extremely fast just dont forget to use extra memory card and shift all your downloaded applications on the sd card an a device
3394	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	never had such a wonderful experience with micromax i always have been using micromax phonesits reallly a good move to compete with moto and xiaomi
3395	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	im using this phone since 10 months this phone has very good specifications and working without lagging like other samsung phone with this price 6k and im very much satisfied with it except one thing that is while calling for long time  its heats up and feels like it will burn your ear which is huge draw back of this phone
3396	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	after a long wait to buy a good brand phone with a balance of all thing and budget extension till 20k i was disappointed then decided to buy mmx fire 2 with a price tag of rs 6309  a smartphone with 45inch display quad core processor1gb ram with int mem of 1gb  phone mem of 15 gb 5mp auto focus rear camera with a bright flash and the premium feature of 2 front speakers is a steal deal at rs 6309  apart form that the battery is of 1900mah  a full charge gives a backup of about 910hrs with heavy n medium usage front camera is ok  black gold option looks awesomely stunning  definitely a good deal at 6k thank u amazonin
3397	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	here is my review after using micromax a104 for three months  pros   a very good budget android phone with premium look  dual front speakers which will give loud stereophonic clear sound while playing music as well as ringing  1gb ram which helps the phone to operate without any lags  clear screen with good resolution  very good primary camera with decent indoor  outdoor picture quality  video capturing clarity is decent  touch screen response is very smooth  battery backup is good 25 days on average usage 1 day on heavy usage  wifi bluetooth transfer speeds are good  has inbuilt proximity temperature sensors  missed call message notifications on lock screen itself  inbuilt torch application  cons   notification led is not present  headset music clarity is average  considering the price range micromax a104 is surely a value for money android phone
3398	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	i was initially hesitating to purchase this phone i have used samsung spice and nokia phones earlier im in love with this one ill tell you why  a it looks like an iphone yes it has got a sleek classy look theres no need for a colourful back case it looks fabulous without any addons bnever hangs i use facebbok whatsapp instagram all at the same time but the phone doesnt misbehave or heat up cat this price what else do you expect it is worth every dime it has 3g facilities my previous phone costs rs 8000 but didnt have 3g  dfabulous sound it has got dual speakers on either sides a music lovers companion ethe 5mp camera is nice with a great video recording drawbacks front camera is poor need a 16 or 8 gb memory card to store apps and files phone memory is unsatisfactory
3399	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	i am impreased  with this product i want 2 know how 2 claim warranty if any thing happens 2 the mobile
3400	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	nice product  the pros are the front speakers through which movie watching is a very good experience without using earphones   i had purchased a093 canvas fire 1  also which also had front speakers  the ringtones are also audible when you are outdoors   i had bad experience with canvas 2 a110 q which has got bad speakers tihrough which the sound is not audible at all while watching movieshearing songsringtones   it has got good looks like that of iphone  the  con is that with the cover the phone is heavy  it takes quite bit of time for charging fully  the regular slim slot has got some problem  using the micro sim slot  heard that canvas fire 3 has come with corning gorilla glass which will be better than this
3401	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	my phone has been damaged in box
3402	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	this was not a good productbattery is almost dead10 days replacement period is not sufficient for testing after that i moved to micromax service center
3403	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	according to me it is one of the best phone at its low price range of 6000rs i previously owned a samsung galaxy fame which i bought 2 years ago for 11000rs for almost half of its price fire 2 gave me better cameras both side higher ram1gb newer os and a bigger screen the only problem is that it has only 1gb of internal memory which is quite low for installing heavy apps that would properly exploit the 1gb of ram which is quite unique for a smart phone at this price range
3404	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	well at first i had a good  experience with this phone but later this phone showed its true colors even i had a 16 gb card installed in it when i downloaded or tried to download something it used to say insufficient space on device it even had 120 mb internal storage in it the camera of this phone is the worst camera i have ever seen the front camera is awful and very pathetic the one star that i have given is because it runs very smooth and does not lags
3405	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	yeah man good phone seems little bulky but when in hand feels like iphone   satisfied with delivery  services provided
3406	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	hello this is my personal review of micromax products micromax products promise to be very good but they are not that their specs are not same in the product we all want a low price good smartphones and micromax attract us because of its low priced products i switched from my samsung phone to micromax a104 the phone is not at all good its screen quality is very poor you cannon do even low gaming on this design is not that good as shown in the pics its sound system is pretty well but not excellent i got a kitkat update on this phone but after the update was installed the phone stopped working  service i went to the service center the guy told me the motherboard has a fault i told him to replace it with a new but for saving his money he said to repair it after the phone was repaired it worked well for a single day after that when i dialed a number the screen gets shut and i cannot even end my call after many resets phone is not working well everytime service center tells me to repair the moherboard but never replace that  dont go for this there are many other phones in the market far better than this now i am using redmi note 4g its the best phone i have ever used in a very low price price 9999
3407	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	camera is great but battery backup when it was new it used stand for 1 day but day by day battery is loosing its life  sometimes it automatically reboots  the mobile which i had brought from flpkrt was damaged  so plz buy this phone leave this and go for motorola smartphones where u get regular updates and which does not hang 
3408	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	mobile stopped working in 1 month i gave to service center to repair just imagine new mobile and it went to service center i demand for new mobile instead of that they ignored it very bad mobile i request stop selling this mobile and people please stop taking this mobile if you will take you are going to cry after some day
3409	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	canvas fire2 is good mobile in 5 to 6 k range it is good looking and looks like i phone screen resolution is good pros nice looking screen resolution 1gb ram firing speaker superb camara  cons battery talk time is too poor just 210 minutes with internet use front cam 03
3410	Micromax Canvas Fire2 A104 (Black-Silver)	i love the handset  i was planning to gift it to my lil bro on his birthday so i did it the handset was on discount at the time ive purchased the same so according to me fire 2 is really very good and handy and typing is also so smooth even the music sound is ok not good but overall it worth every single penny

3421	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	excellent site i got my experia z1 brilliantcondition good job
3422	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	when sony xperia z1 released i was one of the first customers to buy the handset from flipkart with lot of excitementbut trust me i am experiencing pathetic customer service from the customer care and service center department  sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products but in my case i failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like xperia z18230  1 on 24th december when i woke up in the morning i saw my xperia z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet there was no damage on the external glass but however the display had cracked from inside a single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked8230  2 in my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18000 rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on its own from inside there is no sign of external damage on the screen  3 sony customer care executives and sony service center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances they are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status i had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the sony service center i know few acquaintances who had similar experience with service center bhubaneswar  4 my handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me i requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked if i can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why cant the technicians employed by sony do the same  arent they qualified enough  5 while i handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when i received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly i have the photographs available with me  6 i had heard that sony xperia z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me  7 after sending an email to sony senior management in india sony head office support team sent an email stating i have to pay 50 of mrp for refurbished handset without accessories and 80 of mrp rs 28500 for fresh handset without accessories8230 prices offered by local sony service center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price8230 whatever happens to your handset sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k 30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment8230  it8217s really frustrating as sony customer service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty designbad quality equipment being used  trust me guys the service being offered by samsung for galaxy s4 which is a comparable model with z1 is much better than sony8230 sony is having the worst after sales service8230 i would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free82308230
3423	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	i absolutely fell in love with this beauty the first time i saw in reviews carries a sense of sophistication elegantly designed and most importantly lends a very premium feel in my hands the feat of accomplishing water and dust resistance cant be ignored if not applauded  oh almost forgot the big thing  the mighty little camera what else performance is snappy battery life is decent  imho if theres a device which compliments both work and social life to its fullest the premium finish lends more of an executive touch  perfect device for work yet it so effortlessly transforms in to multimedia play hub when you want to fall back after a tiring day at office  this device is worth every penny spent on it
3424	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	phone is delivered on timephone is having heating issue during chargingbrowsing and camera is not working when phone is heat upreturn back to companynice response from amazon
3425	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	sony is making fool people please dont buy these phones are only water resistant not waterproof
3426	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	there are unresolved issues with the wifi connectivity of z1 the wifi is extremely slow and patchy especially when compared with other devices like iphoneipadblackberrylaptops on the same router apart from this i am satisfied
3427	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	graphics for gaming is just great have gud battery backup and a solid phone the sony design is cool and has professionalsm in phone design only have som heat issues otherwise its best phone to buy  if not for slight heat generation dono how it is for samsung phones it m8 b stil worse i would hav given 5 star rating
3428	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	superb phone excellent deal the cashback is yet to arrive though
3429	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	a really pretty good device from sony great camera of 207mp with auto focus 8x zoom and other features better display of 1677m colours and full hd display water and dust resistant comes with 2gb of ram and 16gb of rom device having 22ghz of processor which is very fast in single and multiple tasking the device deserves 5 stars but im giving it 4 stars because i hear some heating issues from the users which is caused by the metallic back the main camera is not so good in low light which is a big issue coz the camera having 20mpapprox according to me go for this device without seeing others because the above disadvantages doesnt matter too much to kick this device well device 
3430	Sony Xperia Z1 (White)	perfectly met all expectations great sleek looks good performance
3431	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Black)	except the camera everything is awesome about this phone  it has everything that a smartphone must have and for me 400inch size is perfect  and it works fine when playing heavy games like mortal combat  it stucks a bit because it runs on 1 gb ram but thats negotiable and it does not heat up at all so i will say go for this phone if you have a limited budget
3432	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Black)	excellent device sturdy built  display is not that great especially under bright light nothing can be seen in the highest brightness setting cortana works excellently many people are complaining about battery but i found the battery to be working quite well the offline maps and offline driving assistant apps ie here maps and here drive are awesome just had to do a 1gb download for the entire map of india for offline use the only problem with windows phone is that google services doesnt work only gmail google calender and google contact works using a 3rd party app for google drive no hangouts and no google chrome most importantly there is no youtube app available you have to use ie browser to watch youtube videos  regarding gaming 1gb of ram and 12ghz snapdragon 200 dual core processor does a acceptable quality work based on my observation a lag exist in games when they are started and then things become lag free asphalt guardian of the skies spider man works great on the phone only if you can ignore the initial lag that happens in all the games  camera is more that good for a 2mp pinhole has integrated qr code and ocr scanner in the camera app which i found to be very useful  sound is excellent has inbuilt equalizer settings and 3d surround enhancement  office skype here maps cortana and a host of other awesome apps makes this phone an awesome thingy
3433	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Black)	if you are purchasing your first smartphone or getting one for your parents and you want to save some money look no further the lumia 435 is a great performer for its price tag  it is common knowledge that windows phone os is pretty darn light and snappy it doesnt need  octacore processors to run smoothly indeed even on this humble little device running on a 12 ghz dual core processor and 1 gb of ram the performance is absolutely stutter free  i bought this phone for my mother and it took her about a day to get used to the simple tiles layout coming from a nokia feature phone with keypad it just shows how easy the windows phone ui is even for first timers  anyways here is my pros and cons list for lumia 435  pros  1 sturdy build that youd come to expect from nokia now microsoft feels chunky in the hand but in a reassuring way materials used dont feel cheap at all 2 absolutely stutter free performance with the 12 dual core snapdragon 200 and 1 gb of ram just remember its limitations this is not a gaming device 3 touch response is great no issues like the lumia 535 4 the screen is fairly good for its price colors pop well when you look at it straight from the front 434 screen should be adequate for its target users as well as for those who prefer compactness over phablets 5 network performance and call quality is typical nokia quality 6 works great with a 128gb microsd more than enough for a pocket jukebox  cons  1 the camera is a disappointment 2mp cams with no auto focus have no place even in this price range these days the front cam is strictly for skype calls at 03 mp dont try selfies with it 2 the battery couldve been slightly larger given this is a dual sim phone with light usage it makes it through the day any enthusiastic usage will drain the battery before the day is over so keep that power bank handy 3 the screen fades from any angle other than straight up front plus it reflects a lot of light making it harder to read in direct sunlight  all things considered this is a great phone for beginners as well as elderly people who are just getting used to the concept of smartphones for everyone else you have better speced lumias to choose from 
3434	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Black)	needed a smartphone with whatsapp viber skype and facebook budget was around 7k my friends and relatives told me that getting an android phone was a waste at this price range as there will always be memory issues and poor battery backup also phone crashes are another concern did my research on various websites and there was no phone better 5k than the lumia 435  it has a dualsim seamless system front and rear camera good battery backup and 8 gb memory and windows phones do not crash this was indeed the most tempting and perfect choice for a lowbudget smartphone no regrets
3435	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Black)	i bought this for lumia 435 for my mom now that she turned into mobile freak i was worried it would make her feel comfortable with the interface and to satisfy her requirements this isnt like old lumia phones i went through all the features it had got wide range of options and theres nothing you cant do in this phone times are gone when windows phone had limited capabilities with the windows 10 coming up in few months the  next big thing will sure you take the windows phone experience to a whole new level  more over android phones at this price would hang or stuck up here and there also they slow down eventually with their speed and interface even the my nexus 6 which among the premium phones is not as quick or fluent as it once used to be worth buying this phone totally
3436	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Black)	receive it within 3 days good customer satisfactions amazon india microsoft delivers a perfect low cost devices it comes handy and perfect for me about camera its little lack back but being not a photography addict i liked it

3438	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Black)	i payed rs4735 for microsoft lumia 435 bought from amazon since i had to leave town on the day of delivery i had requested for an earlier delivery which was fulfilled by amazongreat service and customer support  having said that the phone has really good performance with its inbuilt apps and as well as low end games with its 1gb ram capacity multi tasking is easier and also it has sufficient internal memory as well i would say if you need a smart phone with good performance at just 5k go for it 
3439	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Black)	great phone has everything needed in under 5000 smooth sleek lovely with great battery backup and best in touch

3455	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	this is my review for a ultimate phone and i8217m taking this pain to write because this phone deserves to get reviewed  1camera  many people are complaining regarding noise and overall image quality with the stock camera i installed a third party app ie ucam and believe me photos are awesome in good light regarding night capture noise was always a problem with sony camera but in manual mode if you adjust the settings accordingly to the conditions believe me noise will be reduced to great extent i8217m sure people facing issues with stock camera is due to some software issues which i can say that sony will resolve in future updates 2battery  well this is one of the major reasons i fell in love with this mobile 68221 screen and with the most beautiful display i was not expecting anything but 225 hrs of screen on time but to my surprise i got 5hrs 38 mins of screen on time with brightness at 7580 still 10 battery is remaining and the total discharge time from 100 to 10 is 1d 0h 3m which is miles better than any 68221 phones today previously i needed to charge the phone every evening finally i feel i8217m using mobile previously always connected to charger felt like landline  p also i did not use any stamina mode my google sync was on for entire testing along with wifi and gps too  3performance  did not install any games but did not feel like using 1gb ram the experience was flawless no lag at all people complaining about the ram are the ones who are heavy gamers and do lots and lots of tasks for them it will surely be an issue but for moderate users like me using whatsapp gps and google this device is more worth to what it has been priced so overall performance is very very good all credits to sony for their good software optimizations  4display  the first thing you will notice about this phone is its awesome display ips display has done the magic viewing angles are also very good images are crisp and clear even though the pixel density is less but it stands out when compared to other phones displays and bravia engine 2 adds further charm to the display overall a killer display  5body  very sturdy and wellbuilt with good positioning of headphone jack and charger port it feels royal and the glossy finish at the back adds more glamors to the phone about the weight if i do not mention it then it would be unjust for the phone it is so light weight you will never feel you are keeping a phablet in your pocket  6sound  yes i agree the sound is low compared to the speaker size given at the back but who listens to songs on speakers or watch movies using speakers for me i have never done that i always used headphones to listen anything be it songs or movies the loudness is low which i think can be overcome with some software changes after getting root access to mobile which i hope to see soon on xda developers i had xperia s prior to this and i used xperia s headphones with this mobile and trust me the beats and sound is much much better overall not a major drawback it can be overcome by time  7call quality  i did not use two sims tested only with single sim with 3g activated all the time and no call drops ever and clarity was good even in places where signal was very weak also used the speaker during a call it is good if you are not in crowded area as the speaker is not very loud but it is good and can be lived with  8connectivity  no issues at all in this department let me tell you that both sims cannot have 3g sim1 supports 3g while sim2 does not no data connection lost for the entire testing period wifi is also very good and captures signals even if signal is weak did not get time to test file transfer using wifi direct but i8217m sure it will work fine  9gaming  i m a game lover i have played few high end gamesmodern combat4fifa14dead trigger 2real racing3need for speed most wantediron man 3riptide gp2deus ex the fallasphalt8vrtual tennisavp on this device and it runs very well witout any lag or jitterawesome gaming xperienceps4 connectivity  10multimedia  sony in built support fr multimedia is jst amazingwalkman does provide a very pleasing music experience hd movies run effortlessly movie watching is just superbsound quality in earphone is exceptional  that is my experience for this phone and i8217m very very happy with this device
3456	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	super phablet day light camera pics are very good in low light noise is there but front camera is badnow apps can be transferred to micro sd card so no problem with internal memorysuper speed no lag i bought this phone on april 2014 for first two months phone restarts itself for more than three times a day but sony has updated its software  now updated to kitkat 443 now for five months it did not restart for a single timenice updation the display has natural colours but the colours are not that brilliant and colourful as same hd samsung htc moto or lenovo phones if u transfer a picture taken by ur sxt2 ultra camera to a samsung or htc hd smartphone it will look brilliant and more colourful on the other phone the same games also will look more colorful on samsung or htc or lenovo phones but i prefer natural colours on my sxt2 ultra camera features are very handy the build quality is very nice and beautiful but be carefulthe back is very shiny black and can get scratch easily so i am using a transparent back cover i am not using a flip cover because i dont want to hide its beauty dont expect too much loudness from this phone speaker but use a good headset and do some adjustments in walkman sound settings sound quality will be great 3000mah can stand one full day with more than average usage the most important thing is its user interface lovely key board  notification lightgps messaging callnfc pairing with other devices are very easy i wish it is water resistant but for 24k it is more than enough
3457	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	it is the mobile actually i am looking for brightness of the screen is something extraordinaryvery huge in size initially bit disappointed but now happy with that particular sizeram is 1 gb but its ok bcoz playing fifa 15 without any struck internal speaker is not goodelse everything good

3459	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	i bought this mobile after going through many android latest models this model is really suitable for those who want to replace their tabs phones and looking for both the features in one handset i had a ipad and iphone but this phone served both with the below features  1 big 6 inch screen to watch the movies 2 good for photography amateurs 3 good for music lovers 4 good for game lovers  very bad for 1 who are looking to handle the phone with single hand 2 ram is bit slow when compared to iphone  overall i shifted from iphone 5 series to sony but i am very happy with overall performance of this phone as a phablet
3460	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	first of all thanks to amazon for delivering this product i am using this phone for a month some of the highlights of this phone 1 brilliant 634 triluminous display 2 3000 mah battery almost withstanding for 2 days for normal usage 3 stunning camera clarity and its inbuilt features like ar effect timeshift burst etc 4 performance of the phone  the only con about this phone is the sound quality its is clear but not that much sound since sony is remarkable for its loud sound quality but in this phone it is missing i am not a heavy game user and i have shared my experiences based on my usage this phone is the right choice for those who love to see hd videos movies and for its display
3461	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	it is a good mobile who wants to take dual sim piece i have not seen any problems till now i suggested to many people to go for this
3462	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	it my expectations the large screen is extremely clear its my first sony android so i am getting used to the sony experience
3463	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	great phone  user interface nailed it hardware is good and can do one handed operations all but one factor to consider is ram  which should be at least 15 gb because  of android system updates are late for this model especially good for reading if you are a book worm
3464	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	good stylish big mobile on camera front both rear view and front view clarity is not good  particularly in front view we could see only rashes  sony famous for camera is not to be trusted for in this mobile version  sound effect is also less

3470	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	this phone is marvelous till it functions properly within 10 months of its purchase it has started creating problems  the worst part is the useless company service center  call center i bought it thinking only of the brands image but that is nowadays not the earlier one some great employees of sony itself is bringing the companys image to the disrepute

3473	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	sony xperia t2 ultra dual is a great phone with great features its a 6 inch phone with 1080 resolution quad core qualcomm snapdragon processor very good performance ram is great and storage is also great camera with bravia engine i get brilliant pictures  videos from rear camera touch is awesome i am in love with my phone and all this just for rs 25000 only you get 40000 phone features in a 25000 itself it looks awesome and works awesome its been more than 3 months now but till now this phone never had a hang problem or any other issues sound is great but loud speaker is not very loud but in earphones you geet hear great music with intricacies and front camera is not that great its just okay for selfies would get disappointed  overall its a great phone with very good features and big screen versatility and if you want you also have  other nfc and bluetooth gears  available for this  phone i am very happy with the phone complete satisfaction for the money spent
3474	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra (Dual SIM, Black)	gr8 camera 1 gb ramis not enough i can only use half of my 8 gb rom rest taken by android warning dont update phone will become frustratingly slow i end up uninstalling updates plus update will eat up rom space

3481	Sony Xperia Z1 (Black)	the phone is no doubt awesome i will recommend every one to have
3482	Sony Xperia Z1 (Black)	super product  never regretted buying it pricey though
3483	Sony Xperia Z1 (Black)	battery backup is poor except ths everything is superb
3484	Sony Xperia Z1 (Black)	the phone is quite fast although becomes hot on prolonged usagequite heavy as well the camera is good for  daylight photography only competitor in my opinion is the google nexus 5
3485	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	i dont think lg is capable of making a 50 k phone and its worth spending so much moneythe touch screen will develop  sooner or later
3486	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	it may look similar to g3 but lg has done a lot to differentiate it from other flagship devices lg g4 is not just about specs but also the quality it holds as you can see the bezels are smallwhich is really good for gaming and viewing fullhd videos the phone has a beautiful curve which make it excellent to hold the display is surely one of the best to date and has to be seen to be believed led notification has over 8 colorsdifferent for different notification lg g4 has a removable battery which is rare in flagship devicesthe battery backup is stellar for such a powerful device better do a research online about battery before buying snapdragon 808  is surely a cooler version of 810heating issues solved to some extent  the benchmarks may not be better than some other flagship but the real life experience is somewhat different and better at the end you dont need to worry about performance when going for this beast the camera with a 16mp and 18 aperture size seems to perform better in every condition  the daylight with hdr can handle the extra contrast really well resulting is excellent and sharper imageseven though samsung says s6 is best in low light by comparing it with iphone 6they just didnt compare it with lg g4 which has the best 18 aperture size for stunning and sharp low light than most of the competitionthe shutter lag is a little bit annoyingits not the slowest but slow compared to other flagshipselfie is surprisingly sharp thats not the end either the lg g4 has a laser focusing module on the back which helps for focusing at low light and every difficult condition faster the buttons at the back will take little time to adapt to  the sunlight viewability is great the specs are definitely future proof it also has optional wireless charging feature which is qienabled  above all the price is low than other flagships  update lg has released an update to fix some minor issues with heating and all update pics
3487	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	this is a phone with some very good featuresi expect even more innovative technology from lg  processor and display it8217s a fast phone thanks to its fast 64bit snapdragon 808 processor opening of even larger apps is fast and smooth resolution of 2560x1440 is incredible for a sharp 558221 quad hd ips displaythe sharp images with natural looking colors looks awesome but similar screen is already available in number of smartphones and i think this feature has reached saturation as far as screen is concerned  camera the rear camera is 16mp with optical image stabilization with sharp image quality it uses laser focus feature of lg g3 for better focusing highres 8mp front camera can take good and sharp selfies it can take video at 4k resolution with very realistic colors  storage it has got expandable storage feature cloud storage is not a very useful feature in indian context where internet speed and accessibility is still limited compared to western countries so i love this feature in a smartphone the lg g4 comes with 32gb of built in memory and it can be expanded up to whooping 2tb terabytes the only problem is that 2tb microsd card is not available in the market   battery the battery is removable with capacity of 3000mah which i think fall short of my expectations from a lgs flagship device i expected wireless charging feature which is missing from this device you can remove battery to restart phone in rare event of freezing of phonewhich is unlikely with this mobile you can also carry an extra battery rather than a power bank for backups i personally like this feature  some other features  android lollipop version slightly curved design with leather finish loud speaker interchangeable back covers screen tap to wakesleep builtin in battery monitor camera support voice commands etc  only thing i didnt like in this phone is location of speakerlocated at the back  in short its a high level smartphone with fast processor awesome screen and amazing camera price of the phone is competitive compared to others
3488	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	recently bought the device it is really an excellent device get amazing discount and cashback offers offer pagehttpamznto1suiyme  amazing performance  camera is perfecto battery is awesome no hanging problem now what you need more than this in a phone display is superb and the service by amazon is really really good worth buying this product from amazon
3489	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	got this one from lg brandstore the leather black edition its is pleasure to hold this device the display is stunning  2k  i had note4 but this one overcomes the size and features the battery is comparable to note4 no complaints in performance as well got it on 9th june in prebooking phase i was planning for s6 but this one is just so amazing to be owner of photos are amazing android 51 is running phenomenal on this device not a single crash found in last 11 days overall excellent buy i would recommend this to anyone looking for powerpacked performance within 50k
3490	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	firstly unique design is a great thing that only lg can offer no heating issues as per date16 mp cam is extraordinary selfies are too good overall design is awesomefull day battery backup with 3g data ondisplay is sharper than g2overall excellent performance go buy it i got extra battery one extra leather quick circle caseoverall it is a great innovation frm lglg needs to promote this beast go for it buddies
3491	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	as usual android smartphone with spec oriented win but actually need to appreciate as lg has introduced qhd and lg has introduced dual sim on a flagship with both lte4g support sony must learn from this always removable battery is one of the main key point of lg success
3492	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	well first of all i loved the way big b held lg4 in that promotional pic on lg8217s site the class and elegance it showed in that pic made me buy this phone it8217s not that i didn8217t research about the phone at all but big b was one more factor for me to burn close to 50k on this phone after using this phone for a week i8217m not sure if i have made the right decision you will know why am saying this am not going to talk about all the good things about this phone for that lg has already created a damn good site go there and check out the specs features and amazing photos am going to talk about my real experience with this phone so here it is  fluctuating price i have never seen the price of a product fluctuating even before it is officially launched lg broke my perception about stable pricing even before g4 was officially launched you could buy it from 45000 to 50000 it8217s your bargaining skills that would fetch you a deal you want this price variation is very scary imagine you buy this phone for 49999 and your friend comes and tell you that she bought it for just 40k believe me you will feel bad lg should have controlled the pricing of its phone at least before the official launch shouldn8217t they  heat it8217s already very hot in most parts of india buying this phone would only increase your body temperature i used it for 30 minutes for google maps and then i got a call i couldn8217t keep this phone on my ear it was that hot agreed that you have got one of the better processor on board but that doesn8217t mean that i won8217t be able to use the most basic feature of this phone after installing temperature guard app i noticed that the battery temperature reached 46 degree celsius i8217d to switch my off on the other side i believe it is lg8217s marketing strategy wherein they would want g4 customers to buy an lg ac  why should i  battery has no life if you plan to use this phone for gaming net surfing chatting and of course calling then please keep the spare battery on charging 8211 always this phone can8217t handle even 23 hours of usage today i checked the amount of time it would take to charge the battery which was at 15  it took 2 hours 15 minutes to charge it to 100 though the company claim 100 charge in 1 hour 10 minutes imagine your girlfriend wants to make a call using your fancy phone but you tell her to wait because you want to change the battery how many times have you replaced your phone8217s battery at least i haven8217t done that even once but lg expects me to do that with g4 but again why should i  performance better processor more onboard ram but is it really fast i really don8217t think so it8217s just pretty much the same as my previous sony xperia z ultra if you are looking for a really superfast phone well you might be disappointed others have already reported problematic touchscreen issue so watch out for it as well with all these issues already i hope lg really resolves these issues and makes it a real flagship phone not a faultshipped phone
3493	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	loved this phone i only loved its laser auto focus thing too fast  
3494	LG G4 (Ceramic White)	wanna have this one 
3495	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	best budget phone loved it  i dont think if these features are in a samsung or micromax we have to pay almost 8k or 10k  am using this phone at almost 2 weekstill no any problem  stylish look  and one important thing that this phone is an indian origin am recommending to every indians to buy this product u will never dissatisfied 
3496	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	happy to get that phone  its so much like an samsung  very low in price to
3497	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	just got my aryaquite an amazing phone with so many features i didnt expectedits a best phone in this price rangeno other company provides such features even at 10 k rangethumbs up   and the main thing is i can play asphalt 8 without any lagg d
3498	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	poor scratch guard and rear camera is not so good according to price point alsodidnt got any free data from aircel and battery backup is also not enough
3499	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	truly a1  first day impressions  100 vfm device for less than 6k bucks the design is killer one like that of premium phones if the brand is not noticed printed on the back it can easily be mistaken for a high end device like a nexushtc the phone does not feel cheap in hand at all no android device in this segment has such premium looks yet good call quality and decent speaker sound is a little bit plasticky very slightly but does the job well and is loud and clear enough for calls songs and movies there are 3 back panels provided in the box a bright red a white and a black all 3 complement the phone pretty well  pros  feels perfect in the hand thanks to its 45 inch screen unlike devices with 5 inch screens that make it difficult to reach the other corner of the screen with onehanded usage screen is pretty sharp and has decent colours  no bloatware and minimal preloaded apps customized and smooth ui  almost 6 gb available for appsmedia capability to move apps to external storage micro sd card  volume rocker and powerunlock buttons are on 2 different sides making it easy to use with one hand the thumb for the power button and the index finger for the volume buttons the buttons do not wobble and the built quality is pretty decent  good viewing angles in all directions  comes with a factory installed screen protector a glossy one  cool gesture access to apps customizable to any app right from the lock screen  expandable memory otg support and wireless display capability with compatible tvshdmi dongles  the 2 sim card slots are a micro sim and a normal mini sim each this is pretty useful in case you need to pop in someone elses sim card into your phone both the sim cards can work on a 3g network so no more swapping sim cards just for 3g data  audio enhancement option for better quality output through the 35 mm jack  cons  although the battery is a decent 2000 mah it does seem to be draining faster than expected charged it to a 100 and is already in 70s in less than 3 hours of initial setup and app installsbelow medium screen brightness this was however with both the sim cards installed and a lot depends on the signal strength  the feather buttons on the bottom of the screen do not light up thats such a bad bad thing it takes a little getting used to lit buttons are a bare minimum expectation on any phone the buttons do glow a very bright red outdoors  rear camera quality is average front cam does the job for video calls and decent outdoor selfies  earphones in the box not worth mentioning about  slight heat near the led flash during long usage and while charging but negligible  need to remove battery for sim card and sd card removal  final words one really cant complain much about anything keeping in mind the price point this was launched at excellent value for money given the premium design and decent specifications a definite buy specially if this is your first android phone or maybe a second phone at least to show off the killer looks   antutu score 18472
3500	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	first of all i could not connect to internet using this phone secondly i could not find any service centre of salora though i found few contact numbers on google but no one was there to answer to my calls somehow i could connect to their corporate contact number but reception lady put my phone on hold for about 5 minutes  then disconnected my call i did not like the phone at all and customer service by salora now after two weeks handset display is been lost  no phone repair shop can find display for this phone i am still looking for someone who can repair this phone  please contact if you know anyone who can repair this phone as i still like its camera quality i want recover few of my snaps
3501	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	battery capacity was 1000 mah according to cpuz instead of 2000 mah as in the features given camera need to be improved others are all 5 stars
3502	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	there are brands like samsung htc sony etcif this companies make such phones with such build quality they will price it above 10k and thats because they put lots of money in marketing on tv internet radio and allin order to cover all this investment they charge more money also this marketing gives them a brand name and trust which will result in large number of sales and all the money is recovered with profit but here comes a phone will same build quality  specs features everything good and half of that rate and then people think it must be chino cellno its notcompanies like this they do not invest in marketing so they can sell their products at attractive price i recommend this product because it has a good build quality and really good specs and at an unbeatable priceas good as any other branded phone
3503	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	pretty much satisfied with the performancegood battery back upgood ram performancesharp screengood decent cam both front and rear just gets a bit heat up while using net and a bit  heavy thats why i m giving 4 stars otherwise each penny is worth  this price i would recommend this to everyone having low budget and want performance not the name you must go for it
3504	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	i searched in all the sites no where in this price such a beautiful mobile is available camera is superbits otg  facility is like anything only one drawback is its heating while using long time internet rest is very satisfactory  around ten people purchased this set after seeing mine one should go for itits flip cover is not available now
3505	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	its a great phone at this price having no problem till now games are running very smoothly good screen size except it heats up while using and headphones are of cheap quality but give good clear sound manufacturer should solve heating issue and i dont know whether other are facing problem or not many time while i press a on touch pad its doesnt work it might be only my device is having problem but you must go for it as they are having customer care all over india but there customer care does not respond to you
3506	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	ya this is one of the amazing mobile which i had by last month ie arya a1 plus as i was searching an android mobile which is suitable to my budget with lots of features but only with 5k i was feeling like omg how will i get android mobile but suddenly when i was buffering about mobiles i got arya a1 plus then i start to searching about this then i got this is fully featured mobile which i was searching with my budget as am viewing reviews then i got all positive reviews and also some negative my coluges also told that for 5000 buks it is very reasonable  but i had in mind there is no service station still i want to purchase this as this is my first android mobile and about arya a1 plus as how arya movie make us to feel the love like this this mobile also feels me same i really have crush on this mobile yar primary and secondary camra is no words its like sonys camra as i start to using camra my coluges are told me that may be sony camras company merged with this that type of camra is their for whom to love to take selfies its really really awesome but i have also negative as if we use more than 10 minutes back side around camra its coming to heat and battery backup is its like average mode if you charged 100 and start operating than approixmetly 56 hours backup if u start using only for calls in between 15 minutes browsing 15 minutes for gaming then battery backup will give you for more than 26hrs you know why i gave 4 star instead of 5 because of battery one more thing i read as something about call disconnected hanging and all but as i was using from past 1 months still i didnt got anything and i fully believe that in future also i will not get any problem apart from accessories and battery this arya a1 plus is super rocking mobile for 5k

3509	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	given the hype around the product it failed to even match 10 of expectations it heats up like a hot pan while calling or using any basic function speaker quality is really bad 9 out of 10 times while on call voice break is a common feature its not about being lowcost there has to be some basic functions working properly dont buy it
3510	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	arya a1 overall the mobile is very good no battery problem no heating problem both the camera nice but both the sim does not catch 3g signal even my both sim is 3g enabled and in our area 3g services are available as seller  manufacturer claimed dual sim slot are 3g enabledother mobile does best work in respect of 3g
3511	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	great phone i have brought this phone last month from amazon for 5k the look of the phone was pretty good it comes with three back pannel the phone is working pretty good and the battery backup was decent battery lasts for one day of normal use it is a great phone for such a price range
3512	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	i purchased this wonderful mobile a month back i thank amazon for the nice offer to its customers and i find this mobile is really a good one equals itself to all branded ones in the market i do not know the reason why the manufacturer not making any ads or special marketing  for this wonderful piece being an indian company i am proud to have this indian product in my indian hand challenging the so called branded ones in its technology it is user friendly touch is good having all options for any age group having 255 service centres in india but i have not visited any one since i have not come across any sort problem so far but i have no experience playing the games in it for which i have no timegood one  for all office going people and hard working studentsworth buying for 5k
3513	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	a good looking phone with a huge drawback
3514	Arya A1 Plus (Black-Silver, 9.5mm)	phone is pretty good depending upon cost performance and featuresbut the services after purchase provided by salora is not goodthere customer support never answers to ur callseven though phone is under warranty ppl at service center are asking for repair charges
3515	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	canvas doodle a3102 has surprised me in more than one way i had planned it as a birthday gift and had done some research on mid range smartphones for a month or so before zeroing in on this one it provides more bang for the buck than any other phone in its category ok some of its attempts are very indian like the games etc which coincidentally reminds me of nokias much fabled 1100 launch 10 years ago but overall its a wholesome package when one compares the samsungs of the world no wonder why samsung is steadily losing its market share with its overpriced phones i had bought a galaxy s duos las year and it runs like s  the pros of canvas doodle a3102 are its size the display ok for those who are looking for real crystal seek out apple 5s and the features that they provide for a little over inr 65k with a free back panel and screen protector thrown in for good measure the batterys chunky and can run for 55 to 6 hours with a bit of everything calls videos surfing games  you name it there a several customizations in the android 44 that are available only in inr 10k phones and can be compared with the mid level htc phones  the cons are few  the camera is good but the colors are a bit mellow the touchscreen is sometimes unresponsive gamers beware and in my case the back panel did not fit in snugly in my handset  overall a good phone for that money and unless one is expecting the performance of samsung grand or something of that range i bet wouldnt be disappointed with this purchase
3516	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	recvd this mobile todat rs6100 thru amazone was desperate to unbox this mobility cz review was just saying bad quality of  volume n camera volume with earphone n without earphone is quite inpressing though the music bass r nt grt camera is vry poor so far working smooth display is not grt specially picture resolution i m tryibg to play videos which is not playing properly eventhough aftr downlading mx player nt undrdrstanding the problem you tube is playing good while insertibg battry just felt its delicate n damaged kind  so nt sure whtr to send it back or hold it over all at the 6k range its good too early to give stars as i just unboxed it
3517	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	exelent prodect by micromax fast servise for amazon in  a special tnx 4 gaffar deals 
3518	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	i had read that micromax is quickly gaining popularity in the indian market that diminished my apprehensions about the quality of the products offered by the brand unfortunately my apprehensions came true once i received the phone the build quality though is ok but the overall packaging of the product is very poor ill list them down  1 speaker volume is very low you can barely hear the rigntone even at the highest setting 2 camera  the lesser said the better ive never seen such poor performance even from cheap chinese phones daylight pics are passable but low light pics are horrible as a matter of fact in low light you cant even see the subject properly on the screen after a software update the situation has deteriorated even further now ive stop using the camera all together 3 batter life is nothing great inspite of its size 4 screen resolution is ok  overall very disappointed with the product but it has definitely helped me in steering away from the non established brands for ever
3519	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	please go for 1gb doodle which is newly launched this set is good but little bulky and screen resolution is not hd do good homework before placing order of this set
3520	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	i am writing this review after 2 months of use because initially we cant see all the pros and cons that apears later i am happy to say its performing good 1 good battery backup i was very disappointed with my samsung galaxy s3 2 no laghang till date my nokia c601 was horrable 3 screen is big to navigate resolution a bit low and its visible compare to other phones 4 signal catching power for duel sim is also good 5 head phone sound was not excellent but when connected with a blue tooth headset its excellent 6 vodeo chat works good with 3g vodafone network  bad thing is its not that much durable if dropped otherwise it is excellent at the price 6k i got it
3521	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	the product is average dont go for it because of its big screen as everything else is pretty average one can get a better phone at this range
3522	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	everything is good about this phone except for the camera if your are looking into cameras this phone does not live to your expectation even with 5mp rear camera the quality is not that good  but for the other specs the phone is excellent and you can take it
3523	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	i have placed an order of micromax canvas doodle 3 a102 blue 1gb ram on 6102014 in amazonin on 10102014 i have received the mobile but the specifications of the mobile are quite different as mentioned in the website internal memory is 1gb in place of 4 gb mentioned in the website as well as os is jelly bean in place of kit kat mentioned in the website it is surprise that reputed company like anazon is involved in such type of unfair selling i have computer knowledge that is the reason i found the mistake but most of the persons have not and they accept the mobile expecting that company has sent right mobile to them is this the only reason that they offer special rates for online customers
3524	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	i donno whats wrong with the folks i just found no defect with my doodle 3 and everything works perfect initially many people said me to nt to buy doodle as it is nt good bt still i bought it as i loved all the features it had might be initially doodle was not doing good but guys dont come to a conclusion that doodle is not good its really an amazing set after i bought doodle many people had to regret for their words bcz it was far more better than theirs and it was available just for around 7000 rs if i had heard their reviews today i wud nt hav purchased my lovely doodle but my doodle was inbuilt with android jelly bean but was upgradable to kitkat version
3525	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	this is my second feedback at first i was satisfied with the product as it reached me safely and within time i expected but now after three months of purchase and use i am really angry and not satisfied with the performance actually i gifted it to someone else and at first the phone faced software issue after clearing that next problems in phone were coming in front like 34low battery backup34 34slowing down34 34hangups34 in middle big retail and micromax have let me down and have put me in situation of embarrassment i can just hope that after taking the phone to service center they provide me with the replacement
3526	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	this is best option with in 7k with all high end features i am very much satisfied with mobile and amazon service  minus is only out of 8gb rom for user avialable space is 23gb voice is low and camera quality is poor  but over all this excellent phonewith in the budget
3527	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	the camera quality is not good even with 5 mp camera  and sound quality is not so good its soooooo poor in this both aspects rather than this its a veery good 6 inch phone in this  range of money
3528	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	the item was delivered in time the delivery cost was rs6718 main reason in buying this item is its 634 screen quadra core process  android kitkat offered at this much lower price on satisfactory performance of the item  within 10 days i suggested this item to my sister daughter  to my surprise on 06102014 ie on dusshra festival day the same item was offered at around rs5700 since 634 screen battery drains fast one should keep this aspect when buying in overall it is a good value for money
3529	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	good phoneworking wellskype is working welldisplay is goodsund quality also goodbig screen awesome
3530	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	doodle 3 is amazing and totally worth iti bought it  at rs6699 however two cons 1headphone quality is not up to the markmine stopped working in about week 2back cover keeps on accumulating dustit makes the phone look dirty  despite of the cons doodle 3 is unbeatable i am very happ
3531	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	pros  the phone looks premium for this price range  display is very nice and colors reproduction is vivid  liked the additional back cover without the front leather case  cons  swipe function not as smooth as high end phones sometimes have to tap multiple times  the usual complaint in android poor battery life  tip  if you are using google play store do not use network time in the settings as this causes problem logging into play store
3532	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	awesome phone by micromax in judt 7k i am writting this review after using it gir a week it just need to improve camera quality otherwise great phone
3533	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	i got a blue doodle from gabbar deals in amazon for 6650 amazon best in packing and delivery got the phone full new about device battery is really good gives backup uoto 48 hrs if used if not 72 hrs depends on u the phone lags a bit in some areas but good phone in very good cost go for this if your a gamer graphics is clean as well buy a good head phones and pouch which will make this phone cool out of 10 iwould give 75 for this
3534	Micromax Canvas Doodle 3 A102 (White, 1GB RAM)	though a good touch screen but body of the mobile is so week  the quality of screen colours are low all other features are upto the mark
3535	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	in india at least it is not going to get any good response
3536	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	samsung kindly learn from othersgrowup to latest tech and handsets offers by competitive companies  dont be overconfident on your past performance as well as unaware earlier indian market nokia now microsoft still paying price of overconfidence in india in past now indians are no more fools that they buy such an item when lot many other betterbest alternatives available at lesser price  earlier you only need to fight with few companies but now there are lot many for you with better specs competitive price and also after sales services as per my own experience samsuung is no more differs in after sales service with all this other brands and i am sure many of other indians will agree for that  samsung you already loosing worlds biggest market ie china and i am 1000 sure that next will be india if you dont change your mindset of overconfidencemarket leader by valuewise and not perhaps by vloumewisefailure i am predicting for your new aseries handsets which provides hybrid simmemory card ie either second sim will work or sd card perhaps you didnt seen micromaxs failure for his past cameo model  can you imagine the major main reason for earlier success of samsung in indiayes you are right availability of accessories and spares whenever someone needs challenge you that ask to thousands layman preferring why samsung you will get mostly this reason for choosing samsung  but fortunately and unfortunately for samsung other players have started providing such things with handsets itself and that has lead to their success in past and will be in future  good luck samsung to loose 2nd largest handsets demand market of the worldindia
3537	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	fire your rd team with ideas like this you cannot beat xiaomilenovomicromax
3538	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	worst phone ever  512 mb ram are you kidding me this is 2015 with phones like redmi 1s have delivered 1 gb for just 6999 way back in 2014  grow up samsung  ask your developers to build a good phone and not to waste time on these  to add on  if you buy it today for 7k and try to sell it after a month you can hardly get rs500 
3539	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	buy this only if you have some excess money in your wallet and have absolutely no clue what to do with it for rs 7000 you can get far better specd phones from other brands  its 2015 samsung not 2012a high profile oem like samsung should at least provide 1gb ram when selling devices for this price range they dont do this coz they think ppl will buy a phone looking at the brand not the specs not anymore  naming a few to consider over this with 1gb ram 1 lenovo a6000 2 xiaomi redmi 1s 3 android one devices 4 micromax unite 2 5 huawei holly etc
3540	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	samsung you guys must be blind to not see your market share eroding day by day still you guys bring such dumb phones at this price
3541	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	samsung need to change his rd team already 1gb ram with quad core processors available in the market for the price of just 6999 seee lenovo a6000
3542	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	worst specs a top of the line company can ever give whats their strategy to go down like nokiablackberry did they really have to do some serious rethinking on their overall price strategy none of their phones they have released in the current year are upto the mark as far as price is concerned wish someone from samsung should see these reviews
3543	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	i cant stop laughing seeing the specs look at the pathetic screen only 43 and wvga res and that too for tft and the thicker than a6000 i think they had designed this phone two years back they might have ran out of ideas so dumping those from the library with the 3 year old specs
3544	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	512 mb ram even wats app will hang on this no need to release it poor samsung
3545	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	i really dont know how samsung making this kind of crap phone but the best comedy part is amazon madness by selling this  the worst configuration over priced mobile in 2015 it doesnt even worth for 83773000
3546	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	clearly samsung is out of its mind they are trying to sell a substandard smartphone in terms of specifications and as a result the user experience as well for over rs 7000 in 2015 when there are smartphones like the lenovo a6000 yu yureka xiaomi redmi 1s xiaomi note 4g android one smartphones asus zenfone series huawei honor holly motorola moto e and moto g micromax canvas turbo etc there is absolutely no reason to buy the galaxy j1 in 2015 it is a 34smartphone34 that should have been launched in 2012 or should be priced below rs 4000
3547	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	how on the earth samsung try to sell a crap phone like this 7190 its an end of samsung era wake up samsung please ask your designers to think 95 of your smartphones have the same design
3548	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	if samsung will continue designing this type of phone then other brands will overtake samsung in near futuremicromax already has come at no 1 in india  design of this phone is almost same as other samsung phonessamsung does it again and again ram is only 512  processor and camera is fine for this budget phone
3549	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	i purchased 2 galaxy j1 phones from pure talk usa and both had to be returned for the same defect  when the phone works it is fine i have no complaints about the specs or voice quality the problem is that about 50 of the time i couldnt  make or receive a call all i had was  an error message not connected to a network its not a signal issue my galaxy note 3 works fine  one inch next to the dead j1 rebooting doesnt help  switching sim card with the note 3 doesnt help going out to the yard doesnt help im not trying to hurt pure talk or samsung we have a samsung tv samsung tablet and the note 3 with pure talk they are all good products after returning the 2nd j1 i got an unlocked  galaxy s4 from target for  291  installed the pure talk sim card and i couldnt be happier
3550	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	wake up samsung just look at the specs  5mp camera 512mb ram 43inch wvga pls display 1850mah lithiumion battery  great right you guys might beat other brands by changing one thing just one thing the price make it  priced rs2999
3551	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	amazon exclusive samsung phone launched in 2015 with only 512 mb ram with a price of around 7000 there is nothing special in this phone that can justify this price tag  1 ram  512 mb with the kind of memory management samsung has you expect this phone to hang and lag numerous times instead you can buy phones with 1 gb ram at a much lower price from various manufacturers  2 camera  5 mp with this price tag one expects at least an 8 mp camera  3 android  v444 kitkat one expects to buy a phone with lollipop in 2015  4 processor  a7 dual core 12 ghz its fine but need to see the performance once we use it
3552	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	joke joke joke joke joke512 mbhahahaonly 512 mb ram for 7000 rs samsung u r ranked 2nd in indiasoon you will be ranked 12th if keep on launching laughable products dont consider india as a dumping ground
3553	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	well the price should be rs4000  for this specifications not rs7000 my galaxy star duos gts7562 was a waste piece after using it for 11 months only and its a cap now going to purchase a new one definitely not samsung
3554	Samsung Galaxy J1 (White)	deserves a negative rating lol d even 2gb ram phone is available for near 7000 let alone dual core  other pathetic specs and also theres the super laggy touchwiz even 3gb ram phones tend to hang thanks to touchwiz lol d

3557	Xolo Q1200 (White)	a fantastic phone worth every penny the box i got also contained a screen guard and a flipcover for the phone which was not mentioned anywhere either in the product desc or in the reviews this itself will cost around rs500 if we have to purchase them outside the phone build quality is also very good and it looks it will last a very long time i have been using it for less than a month so i cannot comment on the battery or other details the android 422 os also is highly customized with a lot of new features added by xolo waiting for them to release the stable release of android 44 to try out the beta version is already available on their website  overall highly recommend this phone for anyone with a 10k budget
3558	Xolo Q1200 (White)	it is worth of money  better than some of smartphones simply superbthank you for giving me this product best ever
3559	Xolo Q1200 (White)	1 either the notification led is nearly invisible or doesnt work on my particular piece not bothered by that issue though 2 i had loved that xolo q700 had a nearly vanilla android the q1200 comes with a lot of customization which i didnt like only makes it more difficult to get used to the new phone 3 camera is exceptionally good for this price works brilliantly in very low light 4 battery lasts one full day  i have 3g wifi sporadic use of gps every 15 min and several apps running that require constant network connection 5 the feel is solid body is well built  however the power button feels oddly placed at the left side
3560	Xolo Q1200 (White)	xolo is the premium sub of lava  which is the indan company   the best parts of this q1200 are the 2000mah battery  gorilla glass 3  damage resistant  which enhance the screen and is great for protection   as per xolo it is upgradable to android 44x which is really a good thing   the 8gb internal storage might disappoint as only 5gb apprx is usable storage left   the metallic design is really pleasing and the best feature is the 8mp with exmor sensor   the screen could have been of smaller size 5 is really big  and internal storage could have been bigger   if the screen size and storage is okay for you then you must go for it  not recommended if you cant handle lags 
3561	Xolo Q1200 (White)	user experience 910 phone ratingspecs and features 1010 overall ratingserviceaccessoriesbrand valueetc 810  let me start with cons first 1single sim 22000 mah battery 2500 would have been better thats it i thaught for 10 min i dint find any more cons about this phone  pros 1 looks like a iphoneuni body construction 2awesome camera sony exmor sensor is good under low light 3 corning gorilla glass 3 4 guaranteed kitkat update in july first week 5 flipcover screen gaurd otg cable etc comes with the box u save 1k for these accessories

3603	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Green)	nokia 435 comes equipped with a qualcomm snapdargon 200 proccessor with an adreno 302 gpu and it the dual core one msm8210 12 ghz cortex a7 one and not even the quad core 12ghz msm8212 this is too bad for the price of 6k what microsoft is asking for yes its definitely a good initiative from microsoft to provide an alternative lumia for the budget seekers but i think this phone is dated plus why should some one go for lumia 435 when you can get lumia 630 with a snapdragon 400 cpu and a clear black 45 inch ips screen for 6k yeah its true that lumia 435 comes with 1gb ram but it simply doesnt have the cpu nor the gpu to fully capitalize on since this is a windows phone the 512 mb of ram would be more than enough for all day to day usage and only while gaming on high graphics the defieciency of ram maybe felt people looking for a good phone at this price irrespective of the os ie windows or android go for android one for 55k or you can even wait for the redmi 2 thats expected to come in a few months for 6k microsoft introduces this phone at a time when budget users are spoilt for choices with so many alternatives at their disposal had they done it a year before then it might have attracted buyers but not now plus their pricing policy is also strange they are even competing with themselves by making lumia 630 sell for a similar price
3604	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Green)	good phone  speed delivery but altleast they can add one normal sim port  both ports are micro sim  windows os is good but not faster and beautiful than android
3605	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Green)	awsome
3606	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Green)	good only flash is missinggood in this rangr picture quality is good battery backup is better than android
3607	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Green)	phone is good at this price but microsoft  store service too slow
3608	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Green)	its amazing window 81 mobile and i am really happy to used this phone
3609	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	this is my first htc flagship butter smooth operations never showed lag or anything this is an awesome phone great display i havent faced any over heating issues so far front cam is the best i ever used excellent rear cam in automode in adequate light is ok in manual mode we can adjust shutter speed iso focus etc and can take awesom pictures and i have seen many complain about battery life but i found it is quite good for a flagship device comparing other flagships out there i am really satisfied with this device
3610	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	just bought the m9 from a nearby retail store and loving it so far i am not someone who plays games on phones but this mediatek processor is not a slouch any current generation high end processor will be enough to perform day to day tasks without a hitch and i am someone who believes that we dont need gazillion cores to use a phone people crying out loud for its bad camera performance should try it again after the firmware update the autofocus is improved considerably and it takes fine pictures now you can play with manual settings to adjust the shutter speed and iso levels to get a perfect looking low light shot  let me give you a short background about where i come from i bought the s6 on the launch day itself and faced the infamous pink tint issue on the screen got doa done from the service center and the replacement device turned out to be worse than the original unit sold the hideous phone at a loss of inr 9k so much for the so called samsung flagship look at the general thread of s6 on xda people are crying all over this pink tint issue  then came the iphone the so called god of all phones bullst got the 64gb version and again ran into an infamous issue faced by many iphone users the screen was literally popping out of the metal casing right out of the box and made clicking sounds while typing messages while apple is busy milking huge profits out of customers the least i expected was stringent quality control apple users make fun of companies like oneplus and dont realize that their iphone may have been manufactured right next door in china  i am a happy camper after todays purchase since everything seems to be perfect build wise on htc and its the best ive used till date quality wise this comes from a person who has used flagships after flagships since 2011 unless you arent bothered about development and are not into custom roms m9 is a good buy and i would highly recommend it if you are someone who cares about custom roms and a spanking camera on the phone this ones not for you this is the most underestimated phone amongst current flagships and i would highly recommend it to anyone to cares about experience rather than benchmarks or names like qualcomm qualcomm seriously messed up with their sd 810 in a hurry to bring out a 64 bit soc
3611	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	recently bought the beastthe phone is really amazing get discounts and cashbacks on m9 i got it at 10 discount offer page httpamznto1j5numz  people are complaining about the poor camerabut i after using it i found there are minor issues i think the camera is also greatthe specs of m9 are really bad ass just love using this phonegreat mobile worth spending some bucks
3612	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	m9 was released in march of 2015 with 14460x6970x961dimensionswith weight of 157g bit heavy and with excellent battery capacity of 2840mahno removable battery and no sar  looking at camera is excellent htc is done with the ultrapixel primary camera now they have fitted a 207 mp camera which is manufactured by sony yes it is the same camera you can find in sony8217s flagships this camera also comes with the raw image capture and 4k video recording htc has been building some of the best built phones of the world lately with the previous generations8217 htc has made a name for itself and set a bench mark with the build quality of the phones they haven8217t gone a bit back with the build quality in the new htc one m9 this is the besthtc has chosen to remain at the 1080p display resolution while all the others opted for 2k resolution the slcd3 1080p screen that is the same that is found in the previous two generations of the phone it is sharp quite tunique but it is still not matching the samsung galaxy s68217s display also many of the previous generation flagships
3613	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	the htc one m9 is an improvement over the m8 in many ways the refined design is gorgeous and the upgrades included in sense 7 lend it a mature feel thats missing from rivals attempts to customise android its also incredibly quick and its good to see that htc has staunchly resisted the temptation to drop microsd expansion that alone should persuade a good section of buyers to get their wallets outit has one of the better cameras in the business if not the best the m8 had the best camera at the point of time the m9 does not have that badge on its chest the phone works well in all scenarios and is very powerful however like most other topend phones these days the m9 too has occasional heating issues battery life is a serious concern too the htc sense 7 ui gives a high degree of customisation that you can play around with and the battery life is good to last a full working day  if you are one of those people who want to show the world that you have a topend phone that looks like one the htc one m9 is one of your best bets it is an investment especially with all the metal in the phone also with htc itself bringing in some good affordable phone you need to take a call on whether there is a need for a phone that costs close to rs 50000
3614	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	disgusting product with disgusting design and price asus zenfone 2 is much much better than htc one m9 asus zenfone battery is 3000mah asus zenfone 2 comes in 3 variants 16gbinbuilt 2gb ram   32gbinbuilt 2gb ram   64gbinbuilt 3gb ram costliest zenfone 2 is 64gbinbuilt which is less than 23 thousand i think only foolish or the people who believe in show off they will go for htc one m9 a wise person never opt htc
3615	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	htc sense build quality are best in class fingerprint scanner is wow battery backup is only con i think one can carry power bank to solve that issue everything else is at its best
3616	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	when htc announced m9 even many htc fans were disappointed seeing there wasnt anything revolutionary in the new m9 comparing to the old m8 so when m9 plus was released many saw this as the real successor to the m8 thanks to better overall specs  despite it sporting a mediatek chipset  processor  m9 plus is powered by an mt6795t chipset while the original m9 has a qualcomm snapdragon 810 on board which is very well known to be suffering from heating issuesperformancewise mt6795t is very good  22ghz octacore  ram  3gb ram makes multitasking and gaming a breeze display  m9 plus gets slightly bigger 52 inches screen with qhd resolution  1440 x 2560 pixels 534 ppi  while m9 only has a 1080 x 1920 pixels  441ppi  screen the screen is glorious to look at with good viewing angles camera  m8s dual camera which is missing in the original m9 makes an appearance on m9 plus however the camera performance is not that better than the one seen on the older m8 or the original m9 dont get me wrong m9 pluss camera is still good but since its a new phone one expect it to outclass the older gen phone which is not the case according to many reviewers online software  htc sense 70 ui on top of android lollipop battery  any phone with a qhd display will need a very huge battery to power up all those pixels for the whole day of moderate usage since this only packs a 2840mah battery you would find it hard to get through a full day unless you are travelling its not that difficult to charge your phone these days so its not going to be a big concern for many fingerprint sensor  yes m9 has got one at the bottom while the original m9 doesnt come with one  should you buy it if you are satisfied with m8s camera then you would be more than happy with m9 s camera i would say this is a better buy than the original m9 since many users are complaining about heating issues with that one if i am not mistaken many buy htc phones for their build quality and htc sense ui if you are among those you wouldnt be disappointed with the purchase  other phones to consider  samsung galaxy s6 apple iphone 6 and lg g4 have better cameras  price  i would have loved this priced under 45k
3617	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	too much highly priced
3618	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	i have been reading so much about this phone not using a snapdragon and instead going for a mediatek processor  so let first start by saying commenting on products with half knowledge  mediatek is a new co and thats it there technology is no way inferior and in fact they are the first and only true october core chipset manufacturer in the world thats different to all the other octo core processors around all please comment on technology only if you know something about it stop taking brand names  its not brands which makes a difference but the innovation in it
3619	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	lovee this phone better in everyy aspect than s6 best display great battery life expandable storage boomsound speakers radio n much much better performance with sense still looks class in front of s6 that seems like a confused device no lags or hangs like touchwiz highly recommend
3620	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	such a good phone
3621	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	might be an awesome device but one will really regret buying it if for any reason one has to go through the after sales service center and customer care service not worth spending so much money talking from personal experience post purchasing a premium device worth 40k
3622	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	it is the best android phone with price range above  40k  amazing features in this  new model but given  price range is high to compare flipkart
3623	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	nice mobile htc is number one
3624	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	excellent 
3625	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	mediatec  soc  why  no reason totally neglected  50k
3626	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	hardware is as usual very good but one piece aluminum and excellent build quality   display and software are good too   but the biggest con is the chip set  it mediatek and not qualcomm  so guys investing in this phone may be a risk so be aware  better go with samsung s6 it currently has the best display best camera and the best chipset exynos 7420 has performed extrememly well so be sure no purchase this or no
3627	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	im giving it 3 stars because of its good display and flagship device htc offers approx 20mp back camera which is not so good in auto focusing pictures arr not cleared as they have to built qulity is very good but the device get heated im disappointing with device because it has a microtek chipset which makes the device poor if you are use of m8 than dont upgrade to this device
3628	HTC One M9 Plus (Gold-Silver)	i am going 2nd star because htc use mediatech ic and all chip mobile use mediatech ic and they have so many problems
3629	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	bought jivi jsp20 week back  black colour  let me list pros and cons here  some apps dont work i will tell u how to fix them  looks and weight are awesome seems like a high end phone   touch is very good  pros  1 awesome looks for that price 2 touch is very good 3  dual sim wifi is ok  cons  1 camera quality very very bad 2 in ear phones quality is very very poor 3outdated android version 4 default browser crashes most of the time  for this u have to install opera android  manually   google chrome android version does not support 4 some apps dont work like whats app and google play  for this you have install  apps manuvally  download apk file of anything u want to install  like if u want to install opera download operaapk  copy that file to external sd card and you can install it from there     some apps require rooting the phone  but rooting of the phone may void warrenty  buy this phone only for looks and lightweight  and if u want to taste the android  browsing is ok if u install opera browser  u can clear browsing  history too any help in installing apps  please feel free to ask me 
3630	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	a phone that costs only 1999 rupees and is allowing you to do multitasking as well as social networking at the same time and also looks quitet stylish in my opinion 1 battery it comes with a 1350 mah battery pack which gives u a full day of medium usage 2screen it has a 3534 hvga screen which is quite vivid at the same time and also has a ogs display which quite good at this price point 3 camera it has 2 mp fixed focus camera with led flash which captures decent images at this price 4 speaker the speaker of this phone is really loud and is audible at any scenario and has some bass also 5 ram it comes with 128 mb ram which comfortably runs android on the phone and runs all your basic apps 6storage it has 32 gb of expandable storage and inserted a 16 gb class 10 memory card into it and it was working well 7 connectivity it has wifibluetoothfm wifi connectivity was good as it captures my routers signals quite comfortably verdict anyone who wants to evolve in the android ecosystem with a really good smartphone without spending a bucket full of money can choose this phone which can easily fill your basic needs at such a low cost
3631	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	pros 1low price android mobile 2having flash option 3ogs display means better than tft and led display 4stylish design  cons 1outdated android versiongingerbread 2no zooming option 3ram is very lessonly 125mb means u cant run more application  4no 3g atleast doesnt have front cam 5battery is average only 1350mah
3632	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	it is very nice mobile in the price range of rs2000 working fine good battery pack up only problem is very small letters in the keyboard my rating is 45
3633	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	all jivi 20 user must check 34 manage app34 to see what applications are running and stop them when not in use  it prolongs battery life and less hangup  it is a good mobile for 2000 as all apks works well and you can install new ones as i have now a  unblock me game and  call recorder installed
3634	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	black color looks attractive than whitenice mobile for this pricefree flip coverworking fine128 mb ram is very less could have been 512 mbaudio sound low battery backup low could be increased
3635	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	a very good service from the amazon  an excellent phone for the basic users with wifi bluetooth hot spot features excellent display sound  music but a very very poor picture quality captured by camera and more over no inbuilt games feature  over all an excellent smart phone worth of low price for basic users
3636	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	you can not download working software on this phone as play store  google play dont support it as modem you can not link with your pc for internet so as a phone it may working but as the part of internet it is not useful
3637	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	all great for a basic smartphone at this value camera is real disappointing not sure if it is 2 mp have other phones clicking better quality with same camera specs overall worth the cost even it if it lasts 8 months 
3638	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	received the phone yes at this price range this phone is good enough to give basic android experience tested wireless bluetooth mobile data camera music  fm radio all working fine as expected while browsing net or opening some app it lags a bit sometimes but it is obvious since the ram is only 128 mb have never opened whatsapp  facebook i know it will lag or hang so there is no point trying to push and as for me i didnt buy this phone for facebooking or to use whatsapp i bought it as a replacement for my 4 yrs old nokia 110 and to use it as basic phone with some android capabilities the phone call quality is surprisingly crisp  clear sound is bit on the lower side but the quality is enough via bundled earphone for casual listening touch screen fine and quick in response sometimes a feel of slow response may be experienced but i think its only because of small amount of ram play store is not there it may be have been purposely left with amount of 256 rom there would hardly a space for it so installing app will only be through apk downloaded through other mobile and transferring it here transferring data is no problem you could do it via bluetooth or by plugging the phone into pc via bundled micro usb cable and port but remember try not to install too many apps resource hunger apps should be complete no no install what you really require chose apps with as small footprint as possible dont expect angry birds to run here try to utilise as much as possible the bundled apps instead of installing  heavier apps with similar functionality as for me i install fastnote for note taking opera mini for browsing but it seems default browser is much faster quick  pic for gallery replacement here too default picture viewer is much faster es file explorer the default file manager suffices but incase i need to transfer files via wifi ill need it a simple unit convertor and lastly a battery percentage indicator the rest of default apps like calculator calendar gmail etc are ok and fulfills my basic requirements as replacement for nokia 110 it has no video player but which dolt will buy this phone to watch videos about battery life i charged it full yesterday and as of now after almost 24 hrs it still has 55 left mind you i not a heavy user only an average user all said i only wish the ram was at least 256 mb than jivi jsp 20 could really have been lowest cost smartphone
3639	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	i have recieved the phone which had the problem of screen and required to be changed any howi went to the service center and they have kept the phone for servicing and had not recieved it back till date  worst productworst quality and worst services both on account of amazon and jivi mobile
3640	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	i feel regret after purchasing this mobile with my hard earned moneyworthless with the features better i could have purchased a mobile to just to talk i mean basic model of any kind  drawbacks 1whats app is not opening 2browser closes automatically when i surf on something 3sometimes hangs 4camera is worthless compared to other mobiles with the same pixel quality  now a days everyone is rushing with whats app messages but in this mobile when i click whats app it says your version of app is obsolete please download after downloading when i click on install it says application not installedyou dont believe it iam not using whats app until now since i purchased from the first launch  there are customer care numbers available to contact extensively i searched over web and got frustrated  i recommend not to go with this mobile bitter experience
3641	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	this is a worest mobile i purchased it on 20 days back from that day onward i started so many problems the mobile struck each and every 1015 minutes and today it stopped automatically what  should i do now i am not under standing so customers dont buy this mobile i dont give a single star
3642	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	good looking battery backup is also good  camera quality is much better than other branded  mobile touch all so smooth internet very fast connecting awesome mobilememmary capacity also good my opinion jsp20 best mobile   low price  android mobile
3643	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	hi friends  happy to say as i am using jivi jsp 20 handsets with the support of amazon sales  i suggest everyone to use the only jivi mobiles which is the best as well in less price compare to all other brands in market
3644	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	i bought just by getting tempted by iys prive 1999 and i must sayyou are getting a phone worth 5k by juat paying 2k a reasonably good battery and tpuch screen very good for people who want it for limited use thanks
3645	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	i was surprised to see this product pricing and just for a trial i ordered it got it last week in hand and i must say jsp20 turned out to be a surprise package a sleek beautiful looking android phone it got just for rs1999 amazing in todays world i guess  so far i am a satisfied customer and one more thing i tell you  looking at this handset in hand my friends and  peers do ask me about it and i think 4 of them have already for it  i think i will go for one more this time in white color for my dad  if you are planning for it  just go for it  the price is so attractive thats its not worth thinking too much 
3646	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	hmm phone is for sure a budget thing to get i was very interested at first due the lowest price a smart phone can be and ordered  just to gift it phone looks pretty good and cute the battery life is very poor phone hangs even while using whats app or even while using file manager u cant upgrade any apps doesnt play many vedio formats u need to convert them first blue tooth and wifi are losing connectivity many times browsing is also very slow if upgraded and increased the memory allotments might do favour little bit of price hike also doesnt matter if upgraded and gives better performance
3647	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	good avg phone cant expect more and its good for the price i would recommend it
3648	Jivi JSP 20 (Black)	i have never ever seen such a useless mobile  this is not worthwhile even it is free of cost wifi not working useless cameras no 3g hence cant use internet even facebook and whatsapp not running properly from 2g connectivity
3649	Lenovo A328 (White)	fastastic phone at this priceits just awsme battery and camera is good no hanging as quad core processor 
3650	Lenovo A328 (White)	i genuinely liked this phoneworking so goodall the features are valuable as far as its remarkable price is concernedif someone looking for this range of phoneslenovo a328 would be 1 of the better choices
3651	Lenovo A328 (White)	the package contained everything to start using the phone including case  screen guard reception  call quality is acceptable all app icons are scattered across home screens which is disappointing facing issue with battery capacity sometimes the charge level drops to zero within 2 minutes when it was at 50 level and phone was idle till that time battery life seems okay
3652	Lenovo A328 (White)	good looks good for average and base users has problems with accessing memory card and even internal memory many applications get stuck and if we switch off the phone it is impossible to switch on the phone by pressing the power switch i have to remove the battery and insert it again to restart it i cannot set personal rigntones because of the problem of accessing memory it automatically changes to default ringtones hence i find it difficult to recognise the calls to my phone apps cannot be installed or moved to sd card  internal memory very less  very often does not display the contact name for incoming calls and messages often fail to access contacts from sim cards i recommend this only for people who use a phone only for making calls and sending messages
3653	Lenovo A328 (White)	mobile body is goodcompany provides back cover also mobile looks trendy but poor back camera as it come without auto focus facility other wise the mobile has 1gb  ram which is best in the 5k range
3654	Lenovo A328 (White)	i odred product on 25th and recieved on 27th i was pretty happy with amazon about product lenovo is trusted brand so phone was good at its price i liked it it is nt the best but price ia also good
3655	Lenovo A328 (White)	good phone in 5k range optimal battery life and performance poor rear flash light which fails to provide required illumination in dark user interface can be better
3656	Lenovo A328 (White)	powerful battery clear pichures all features in your budget only one mistake  a lot of app instaletion no space in internal memory
3657	Lenovo A328 (White)	can not move application to sd card camera click sound can not be muted no lolipop update till now not upto the mark
3658	Lenovo A328 (White)	display quality is not so strong one can explore some other in same price range amazons delivery time was also poor
3659	Lenovo A328 (White)	this is a good mobile in the cost of below 55k but ear phones quality is worrest and back camera is bad
3660	Lenovo A328 (White)	the phone is good battery is awesome front camera is good according to 2 mp and rear camera is not very good but also not very bad screen resolution response  sound is also very good i love its back cover which comes free in the box with the phone in short its worth buying
3661	Lenovo A328 (White)	bakwas phone i m using last 6 months apps running in only internal memory apps not moved to sd card
3662	Lenovo A328 (White)	amazon delivered excellent its good but i dispirited with camera clarity and speakers sound
3663	Lenovo A328 (White)	not good quality product its open the box and start hanging and restart the problem
3664	Lenovo A328 (White)	very good phone with long battery life
3665	Lenovo A328 (White)	worst mobile i never seen such a mobile touch just like korean set blabalapppp

3668	Lenovo A328 (White)	good but only one problem charging is not keep up that
3669	Karbonn Titanium Dazzle 2 S202 (Black)	battery worn out very soon if you use net gps 
3670	Karbonn Titanium Dazzle 2 S202 (Black)	i never found any phone this price and features v good product
3671	Karbonn Titanium Dazzle 2 S202 (Black)	battery backup is not as expected very poor all other features are good
3672	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	the xperia m4 aqua dual is all plastic and glass with a completely flat back and curved sides the black version is especially striking because of how stealthy it looks the sides are curved and have a nonslip matte finish but the flat back doesnt lend itself to a very comfortable grip theres a scratchy seam all the way around where the edges curve inwards to meet the rear  the snapdragon 615 soc powering this phone is now common in phones that cost less than this one but it isnt by any means a slouch the only issue i had was that the upper half of the rear of the phone became noticeably hot after just a few minutes of even ordinary use  the camera turned out to be one of this phones strongest points it handled complex exposures really well and the photos came out with a fair amount of detail intact i was happy to see that compression and noise artefacts were well under control even in low light the camera managed to reproduce better details than i usually see  finally i had to test sonys claims about how waterproof the xperia m4 aqua is and so i left it for 10 minutes in a shallow basin of tap water not only did it continue to run while submerged but it showed no signs of trouble whatsoever after being patted dry with a towel the touchscreen doesnt work underwater but you can use the camera thanks to the physical button waterproofing is a fantastic feature at this price level and you wont have to worry about getting wet in the rain or about any accidental liquid damage  while clearly not competing with the formidable oneplus one  and the like in terms of specs alone sony has packed enough features and usability into the xperia m4 aqua dual to justify its price tag sure you arent getting the fastest processor or the crispest screen but theres a world of difference in terms of polish you also get a morethandecent camera excellent battery life and waterproofing without the inconvenience of flaps over every port  of course it wouldnt hurt this phones chances if it was priced a little lower already its selling for slightly less than its launch price so keep an eye out for deals sony has proven that it can put together a compelling package without jumping into the price war
3673	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	i ordered this phone from amazon i have never purchased a phone in this range so this was really a huge decision for me to take thats why i am a bit disappointed with the phone regarding some drawbacks that it has and those are 1 the battery backup is not up to the mark and cannot last for 2 days by any means it gets discharged even when we are not using it 2 the upper half part near the camera of the phone gets heated up even when we are using it normally for chatting or browsing internet and the battery drains like anything at that time this is a huge drawback for a phone in this range and from a brand like sony looks like we have to use it in ac rooms only while playing games or using large sized apps what is the use of a phone so costly which gets heated up so badly this might be due the water proof design of it but that feels like i have been cheated because i was really excited to get a 2 gb ram phone in sony but this phone due to this heating problem is a disappointment 3 it also hangs sometimes when gets over heated or sometime without any reason 4 not at all suitable phone for gaming purposethats really a sad thing for me  also i would like to mention the pros of the phone those are 1 camera clarity is awesome as expected from a sony phone and the front camera is also great for selfies 2 sound is also great in the original earphones wish they would have provided with the in ear earphones but this is also good 3 the phone works smoothly except when gets heated up 4 the slim look and design of the phone is very attractive 5 the waterproof feature is one of the best thing to get in a phone in this range i hope this feedback was helpful for everyone
3674	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	i got this phone today and the first thins as is normally done with a new phone is charge it while on charging i was browsing through its features and noticed the phone is heating at rear behind this is very surprising the phone is heating just on browsing its features without any sim or without any wifi what could be the defect  please let me know i was excited till i got this phone and now i feel cheated on wasting such huge amount please give some solution
3675	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	mobile is a nice piece of work i chose htc 826 over this but sound in ear phones is pathetic in 826 over all mobile phones sound functionality is my primary preference so best of sound features of all mobiles till now are from best  nokia microsoft samsung sony remaining features are more r less good enough mobile security water proof no other mobile can give you these functionalities battery backup s also acceptable 10 days and no complaint about it go for it c4 has no waterproof
3676	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	got mobile from amazon today afternoon opened and checked the mobile but speaker is not working
3677	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	at the time of use the mobile is heating
3678	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	i bought this product from a local dealer on may 30 this phone has a great display super fast octa core processor  excellent cameras has the feel of xperia z3 it is also water and dust proof  please dont care about the fake review of guys who have not used this phone best midrange phone ever made by sony waiting for the white variant to me in stock at amazon  ill order one
3679	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	the price was too high when compared vth the competitors the only diff is the water and dust proof feature which makes it unique when compared to yusamsunglenovooneplus that are available bw 1020k secondly sony never assure software support guarantee like the the other competitors promise updates for 23 yearsthe display build qualityplasticcameraall the featured apps look good  do check whether its all what you need for 24k
3680	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	dont buy this phone its completely waste  of money i purchased it on 14062015 and after days its speaker is not working and service centre people are saying there is a hardware issue the phone gets heated very fast and it takes 3 hours to get charged and it has poor battery backup
3681	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	amazing mid range phonei am writing the pros and cons pros  camera  battery backup lasts 12 hours for me on heavy usage  5 hours of internet 2 hours of clash of clans and 5 hours of moderate usage   build quality  excellent processor  no lags   waterproof  cons  below par screen resolution  720p  while comparing with its competitors  1080p  htc desire 826 and one plus one  heats up a little bit on playing games which is normal in octa core smartphones  slightly overpriced  i am okay with if it was priced below 21k   if you need excellent battery backup mobile by losing full hd display and you are a selfie lover then go for it or else if you are ready to sacrifice a little bit battery power and need full  hd led display and need a good selfie good ui phone then go for htc desire 826
3682	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	camera is not good sound is not upto the mark on speaker mode sony phones are known for good sound and camera quality but disappointed this time however good in battery backup look wise and outstanding in terms of dust proof  need to improve quality of camera and sound on speaker mode
3683	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	i bought this phone from croma phone is pretty smooth and screen quality is very good camera is average considering i am coming from lumia 1020 i will probably not be satisfied with other phone cameras that easily  battery can easily last a day dont expect more than this  phone tends to heat up a bit however there is nothing much to worry  i like sonys ui on android hence i preferred the brand volume button feels feeble i have my reservations on the buttons build quality however overall build quality is very good
3684	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	dont know why people are creating so much fuss about italmost all the phones has some pros and cons and the same is with this phonei would suggest that you should go for this phonethe only problem with this phone is the heating problem and thats why i have removed one starsince this phone is water proof so you can easily manage the heating problem seriouslyi am not joking but have tried it now n number of times plus the performance is good and it comes with a sony brand way much better then the other chinese s available in market though i would like to add that this phone should be having otg support which is a little disappointingto addi purchased this phone in bangalore in 22 k from a famous shop on marthalli bridge which is way more cheaper then the online prices
3685	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	good things both sims are 4g 128gb expandable is waterproof and has excellent front camera feels great in hand and has the best lcd screen in market  bad things first day use without sim and memory card 62 result heating second day use with asphalt8 it upper part heated like it has been kept on gas upto 50°c rear camera is worst than my current 8mp xperia p no sharpness worst color reproduction battery drained within a day of offline usage  verdict go for it if you work underwater   whats the use of it if its heating and making you uncomfortable every now and then
3686	Sony Xperia M4 Aqua Dual (Black, 16GB)	expensive compare to other mobiles like yureka nubiz z9 which came up with same features

3708	Sony Xperia C (White)	n this segment galaxy grand duos is most popular phone till now but after the advent of xperia c sony has upper hand in the market first advantage is of display and resolution xperia weighs much higher on displayin case of speed processor of xperia cthough from mediatekis much superior to dual core processor of grand duos quad core processor plays smoothly full hd videos multitasking which results in usual hang problem in galaxy grand duos but in xperia c so far i have not come across even once any hang problem after using the same almost for 2 months weight is also lower grand weighs around 200gm where as xperia is around 180 gm on battery front also xperia c outweighs grand duos grand duos has 2100 mah batter where as xperia has 2390 mah so even after whole day use of whatsapp hangout facebook etc battery back up is nice and over 1 day it lastsmoreover in power management it has stamina mode which disables data and wifi when screen is off this feature is really wonderful as sometimes i dont need to charge phone even after two days additionally low batter mode becomes active soon after battery level reaches 15 and then it disables all functions in order to save power when battery level is very low so overall i am very happy after using this phone when i compare it with grand duos being used by my wife dlna sony live slimness walkmanxperia link sketch social life news etc are exclusive features worth mentioning here

3711	Sony Xperia C (White)	pros as you always know about sony that it is best in camera  sound clarity i felt this mobile also stands very good in that aspect the battery backup is amazing it lasted for 2 days with full of browsing playing videos  games the processor is also very good till now ive never seen any lag or hung in the mobile i am using it for the past 1 month and i am very much happy about it  cons screen clarity should have been better for this price
3712	Sony Xperia C (White)	i purchased the sony xperia c 7 months ago and after 2 months the speaker sound became garbled there after recently suddenly the phone became dead when i enquired the call centre the man who attended the phone is not aware of the functions of xperia c phone then i gave it to service centre at kottayam madona care where they said the phone damaged due to water gone inside water might have gone inside due to rain or sweat and they flatly refused the warranty i considered sony is only the brand name and rest is as same as others i had given the phone for service  on 25 jun 2014  and till the date they could not service the phone so bad
3713	Sony Xperia C (White)	i think that this phone is a bit overpriced after a week of usage i felt that i should not have gone for this the front camera is very very poor i think that it is just for sake that they have added this front camera pictures are of very very poor quality all the time it is very dark second thing is the internal memory that is reserved for downloads is very low and so i cannot download any applications via playstore all they time i get a notification that my internal memory is low even when there are only few applications literally im fed up there are lots of bugs in the software also they are not providing any updates i have received only application updates till now stuck at android 422 sony trying to cheat the people with cheap phones i tried rooting the phone when i was fed up even that didnt help after a few weeks i couldnt even apply the latest update for facebook till i rooted the same go for sony z series rather this
3714	Sony Xperia C (White)	ive ordered the mobile on 2nd february only because i saw that it would reach in 24 days the item has reached at my location on correct time but the courier person purposefully delayed the delivery i contacted amazon many times and they even did not take it seriously  there is no phone number to contact the amazon as well when i tried using 24x7 support i had to wait 30 minutes and not connected to any agent at all so i forced to disconnect i never expected such experience from amazon  now coming to mobile xperia c pros 1 good finish and look 2 lightweight  cons 1 camera was not as much good as i expected even though it is 8mp i didnt like it 2 available internal memory is only 12 gbyou wnt get the whole 4gb this is very massive drawback 3 price seems to be a little bit high 4 battery backup is not as much as good with full charge i can use the device only for one day
3715	Sony Xperia C (White)	feature and price wise t seemed to be a good value for money however the set i got has a buggy and very irritating functionalitymany times as soon as i receive a call or pick up phone screen goes blank and then you cant do anything but wait for the person on other side to disconnect this becomes very irritating when i have to join a call where i need to type something egcall customer care and you cant type any option call a global conference and you cant dial passcode on a call to customer care you need to type in some pin and you cant do it how can a big manufacturer like sony be so unaware of such common use cases and release phone without testing it
3716	Sony Xperia C (White)	very good mobile at this price just grab this one soon dont think optional pakka paisa vasool mobile it is
3717	Sony Xperia C (White)	good budget phone by sony httpwwwgsmarenacomsonyxperiac5541php check out the specifications of the phone in the link mentioned so i do not have to say much 5 screen qhd resolution 540x960 quad core cpu with a gpu 1080p recording and playback obviously has a compass sensor good gaming performance decent battery backup 2390mah  non removeable i am recieving regular system software updates via sony pc companion my phone recieved an system update right out of the box so the software support is good by sony and here is how 4gb of internal storage is distributed  1system partition system  116 gb where the android os resides  2internal memory data  098 gb where apps go  3sd card storagesdcard0  your sd card that you insert in sdcard slot 4gb8gb16gb etc  4internal sd card storagesdcard1 120 gb appsdatapicssongs etc partitioned storage out of the 4gb  5 cache  cache  124 mb  totaling 358 gb  good news is that you can move apps to the sd card but also depends on particular apps  comes bundled with few apps converterifitsmart connectsony selectsonymusictrackid  sony walkman music player good audio output speaker and headphones  good build quality  and one more thing the back cover is a bit tricky to open so if u do not wish to damage your back cover which i did check a video on youtube  reccommed buying this  oh and yeah mine came with a 8 gb card in the box and 1 month airtel 3g internet package d
3718	Sony Xperia C (White)	its worth to buy this phone i got this phone with offer price from amazon   coming to sony xperia c  its worth to buy this model around 17k  pros 5 inch display slim light weight dual sim  standby  cons audio quality is less personal settings reset for every restart waiting for update from sony battery drains to 13 when it comes to 30  again waiting for update from sony  overall  good
3719	Sony Xperia C (White)	i bought this phone today on amazon and was very pleased by the speed of the service everything seemed okay until i saw a sticker on the box of this phone which reads 348 gb micro sd card with every purchase of xperia c34 which for very obvious reasons i did not receive it i was impressed by low price but i did really thing he vendor would resort to cheap tricks and cheat people like this very disappointed
3720	Sony Xperia C (White)	i and my friend purchased this mobile  i read its revue and thinking that sony is a japans company i purchased it within 2or3 month  speaker of this phone stops working i went imol  its service center in kolkata there was a long line of peoples with same complain for this phonehowever they told me that online purchase from amazon only we accept here and deposit my mobile an return after 4 days it seems okbut after one week again speaker stooped working  again they repeated same story and returned my phone after 4 daysi am now in doubt how many days it will work and what after warranty period i have seen in service center they told one person to pay 30of repairing cost within warrany period  there is some more issue music player mixes songs from different folders you cant play them separately it makes its own albums you cant coustomise them according your need software updat takes 6 or7 hours with no guarantee you will success i think it is a defective mobile company is selling now i want to sell it in half price i lost my money it is acostly phone for me
3721	Sony Xperia C (White)	pros 1 screen clarity 2 no much lagging 3 batterys long life 4 durable  cons 1 the audio jack is not tight so the earphone gets unplugged often 2 bad rear camera 3 front camera is vga 4 rooting is blocked by sony for this model 5 mt processor and chipset 6 only 4gb internal memory only 12gb available for user cant uninstall builtin applications
3722	Sony Xperia C (White)	i have been using this phone since a month here is my experience so far   the overall build quality and the form factor is very good i have the white one and i find this very elegant and stylish except the notification light which is relatively less visible the back cover is harder to open you have to be careful with that the display quality is good unless you have used fhdamoled before dual sim functionality is handy but changing sim preference is a bit cumbersome there is no dual dial button in the dialer you have to change the sim preference first to make call from another sim the call quality is very good and the external speaker produces enough sound the battery life is very good i get 24hrs of battery life   now about the internals of the phone by not going in mediateksnapdragan debate  i would say the performance of processor and ram is very good i havent felt any kind of lag till now casual games play effortlessly graphic outputs are also good there is a concern with the internal memory you get only around 1gb i am left with only about 200mb after updating the inbuilt softwares there is an option to install your apps to sdcard but i have found that not all apps install by default to sdcard even though the preference is set to sdcard install location i had to do that manually by going in the apps section   overall the perfomance of the phone is very good you can always do the minor tweakings with the software to suit your needs its and android after all   i am very happy with amazon they delivered the product in perfect condition even though the extra headphone was not mentioned on amazon page but i got that too
3723	Sony Xperia C (White)	hi in my mobile sony xperia c i am using sd card of scaondisk 8 gb it was working fine in other phone but in my new mobile it get unmount automatically after few hoursto mount i need to switch off and switchon my mobile but again few hours again it will get unmount please help me to resolve this sd card issue  regards mayank 8056070488
3724	Sony Xperia C (White)	strongly recommend xperia c if you want to frustrate with a smart phone this phone has all thing which frustrate you daily  1 low device memory with lots of preloaded apps which consume device memory and cannot be removed  2 though 8 mp picture quality is very bad which you wont expect from sony  3 no use of vga front camera
3725	Sony Xperia C (White)	xperia c is the first sony device powered by a mediatek processor xperia c is powered by a quad core mediatek mtk6589 processor and power sgx544 gpu  is it worth buying this product  if the price of this device was around 15k  it would be the ideal phone to buy but xperia c is priced at 18k if you can give rs 2000 more or so you can buy a 1080p full hd screen device with a massive 4000mah battery and a better processor ie xolo q3000  even at rs 15000 you can get better performing deviceswith an updated mtk6589 processor clocked at 15 ghz named mtk 6589 turbo xperia c ships with an older 12 ghz mtk6589  from many reviews online it is concluded that xperia cs camera performance is average the 8mp seen in other sony devices is different from this one xperia c can shoot and play 1080p videos natively though thanks to this processor  will this get kitkat update probably not since this is a mediatek device you cant even unlock the bootloader of this device like you do on other sony devices roms like cyanogenmodaokpomniparanoid etc are almost impossible to develop since mediatek devices source code has many issues  update  sony has released a 422 update for this phone  improves the camera quality a little bit

3829	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	its a good product in this price but internal storage capacity of this phone is lesser than as mentioned in its specification ie 4 gb the actual internal memory shows in this device is 17 gb an more storage space is already occupied by apps installed in it so you can not install more apps or you will need instant external memory for this phone
3830	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	nice sony experia e3 operating system is very good  user frendly as compare to other smartphone its very chief with extra operating system
3831	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	the product is good  the only problem with this phone is that it has less user memory less to 2gb to install apps and you need to use any app like sd maid to clean the cache and thumbnails also when you speak on one sim then the other sim is in disable mode for that amount of time  other than this all the features are good  it has good sound clarity and camera clarity   you can buy this phone without any second thoughts a good one from sony
3832	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	a wonderful phone let me first state that you appreciate a phone according to your need and mindset you buy a phone with certain expectations and budget bracket and based on that you like a phone or not i went in the store to purchase one in the range of 13k and after moving around from lg to samsung ended up buying this one using this phone for about 17 daysand here are some points i would like to point out pros 1 battery backup 3g on surfing downloading reading fb twitter whatsapp youtube videoall sorts of things togetherand it will last day and halfand if you cut some of the above activities from time to timeit will last 2 days remember to close the apps when not in use and you will save more power it has 34stamina34 mode and power saving mode and it almost accurately indicates how long more the battery going to last battery is inbuilt though ie you cannot separate it from phone  2 stylish look and built back cover is pretty thin and as like all other sony products handle with care and love volume rocker power on off 35 mm jack charger slot  micro sd slot is in the back you have to remove the back cover to insert microsd card  3 great volume and sound the walkman feature does not play all types of music files though you better download google music which will play all extensions the speaker is loud enough to be heard from other end of the house in same floor  4 processor speed 12 ghz will be enough i did not have any lag or anything so far 5 touch is smooth better than moto ones better than samsung ones 6 answering machine oh ya those who are used to us style answering machines you will love it those who dontstart the habit you record your own voice and ask the callers to leave message 7 tons of apps album has option of revisitng old photos as cover photos xperia has teamed up with facebook and twitter to make things a bit easy for beginners it has a application sketch inbuildshow away your painting skills when you have time or kill time while waiting at the bus airport or not interested in a meeting  8 liv sports and sony liv is thereall sony tv shows are there  cons 1 i assume you are not buying this phone for the camera quality cause i did not while it will serve your purpose of brightly capturing the moment it is not the greatest 5mp camera on earth front camera is vga quality so you better depend on your friends phone while taking a selfie or groupfie  2 nfc unless you have some other phone with nfc features it is not of much use  all in all if you plan for a smartphone around 13k budget go for it brand matters and look matters especially in the age of fast decaying smartphone batteries it will put a smile on your face the battery really works believe me
3833	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	before i can share a review of this phone i would like to share important thing below please read i had bought this phone under freecharge recharge promotion offer by seller techfone and fullfilled by amazon wherein i was supposed to received rs 2000 cashback in 15 days from purchase after 3 weeks there was no sign of recharge voucher i contacted amazon customer care i was told that the promotion was running on different dates than what i had purchased actually this promo was running for 3 different periods on amazon luckily i had saved the amazon webpage in pdf format i called again customer care to receive the same reply so i sent this pdf to them it is only then they agreed i was eligible and confirmed that they are escalating the matter and would get back to me  34 days past no reply so when i called customer care again the same story that i am not eligible i couldnt take this longer so i wanted to complain regarding customer care and i got email id for 34 resolution 34 where you can complain in your not satisfied with customer care at resolution also i got same reply that  i was not eligible for this promotion i was feeling cheated so i sent the same pdf to resolution email id and had informed them that if after seeing this pdf also i have informed that i am not eligible than i would knock the doors of consumer forum surprise surprise the next day i got my rightfully deserved voucher worth rs 2000 moral of the story  save copies of any promotion like i had done or there is no option to fight back  now the review of the phone pros  battery though good lasts only for a dayi had heard a lot of positive reviews of the battery camera good not great most apps can be moved to sd card cons  music too slow on loudspeaker sounds great with headphones earphones check before you buy as nokia headphones not compatible with this set microsim card is a real pain in the a difficult to remove once you insert it
3834	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	phone is very good in almost all aspects  but packageing of product is very cheap and poor amazon should take an action on this
3835	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	just update your android software then you can move the apps to sd card the option can be found in settings 62 apps
3836	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	battery service good
3837	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	good as a device but  memory should be 8 gb to make it excellent  preloaded  apps uses 80  internal memory you are left with 500mb
3838	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	its very slim and unexpected option there nice to use battery 128267  is too good picture quality also good
3839	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	superb phone bright display fast excellent battery and signal reception  better than moto g
3840	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	quality off camera  is not touch my expectations headset which provides with the set is not properly connect with the port otherwise it is ok
3841	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	battery is too good than moto g 2nd genno compare at all with any others phone including 4gits really fast
3842	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	love u amazon look wise no comparesion with thisbody has a rough surface so no chance to slip from hand very very handy mobile music is as sony always provide a bit memory is less and camera is not enough to today generation but overall mobile is excellent i think if anyone want to buy a new mobile then grab it
3843	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	great experience got the product within 12 hours as promised love to shop again and again
3844	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	awesome product sony wow it has its own shape incredible and its quality is too good but it had 2 problems 1 camera is not good it should be minimum 8mp rear and 2mp front 2internal storage is just 173 gb as it should be minimum 4gb apart from it it is a good phone at an good price
3845	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	best smartphone in its range the cameradisplay and sound quality is awasome
3846	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	its an awesome product i got ever i got this awesome phone on amazonin at only rs7999 in an lightning deal its a worth phone from sony but this has a memory concern it has too less internal memory but after all its awesome phone in budget ever
3847	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	with in 2 months this micro phone stopped working now i need to go service centers as i am not busy not able to get it repaired  also storage is 2 gb only not 4 gb as claimed seems i got a defective item never expected this from amazon
3848	Sony Xperia E3 (Dual SIM, White)	good mobile but some apps are not uninstall jo company se aati he
3849	Salora Njoy E4 (Black)	had bought this phone with not much of an expectation however the phone surprised me indeed the configuration of 2000mah battery with 4 gb internal storage around 24 gb available for users and a 512 ram most smartphones at this price range have 256 mb ram does really work out camera is average at best do not expect this camera to take grain free images in low light it does its job more or less in well lighted areas  the look and feel is awesome and the touch screen is more than you can expect from the budget this phone fits in the smart key options are very well thought out if you want your basic phone to be replaced by a smartphone but you are not very confident using an android phone go for it
3850	Salora Njoy E4 (Black)	good mobiles its perfect choice
3851	Xolo Q1200 (White)	a fantastic phone worth every penny the box i got also contained a screen guard and a flipcover for the phone which was not mentioned anywhere either in the product desc or in the reviews this itself will cost around rs500 if we have to purchase them outside the phone build quality is also very good and it looks it will last a very long time i have been using it for less than a month so i cannot comment on the battery or other details the android 422 os also is highly customized with a lot of new features added by xolo waiting for them to release the stable release of android 44 to try out the beta version is already available on their website  overall highly recommend this phone for anyone with a 10k budget
3852	Xolo Q1200 (White)	it is worth of money  better than some of smartphones simply superbthank you for giving me this product best ever
3853	Xolo Q1200 (White)	1 either the notification led is nearly invisible or doesnt work on my particular piece not bothered by that issue though 2 i had loved that xolo q700 had a nearly vanilla android the q1200 comes with a lot of customization which i didnt like only makes it more difficult to get used to the new phone 3 camera is exceptionally good for this price works brilliantly in very low light 4 battery lasts one full day  i have 3g wifi sporadic use of gps every 15 min and several apps running that require constant network connection 5 the feel is solid body is well built  however the power button feels oddly placed at the left side
3854	Xolo Q1200 (White)	xolo is the premium sub of lava  which is the indan company   the best parts of this q1200 are the 2000mah battery  gorilla glass 3  damage resistant  which enhance the screen and is great for protection   as per xolo it is upgradable to android 44x which is really a good thing   the 8gb internal storage might disappoint as only 5gb apprx is usable storage left   the metallic design is really pleasing and the best feature is the 8mp with exmor sensor   the screen could have been of smaller size 5 is really big  and internal storage could have been bigger   if the screen size and storage is okay for you then you must go for it  not recommended if you cant handle lags 
3855	Xolo Q1200 (White)	user experience 910 phone ratingspecs and features 1010 overall ratingserviceaccessoriesbrand valueetc 810  let me start with cons first 1single sim 22000 mah battery 2500 would have been better thats it i thaught for 10 min i dint find any more cons about this phone  pros 1 looks like a iphoneuni body construction 2awesome camera sony exmor sensor is good under low light 3 corning gorilla glass 3 4 guaranteed kitkat update in july first week 5 flipcover screen gaurd otg cable etc comes with the box u save 1k for these accessories
3856	Xolo Q1200 (White)	this is the worst mobile i used i purchased this mobile in july2014 and within 2 months time this mobile has lots of problem  1 battery is not working even within 30 minutes 2 sound quality also not good 3 hanging problem 4because of battery screen also effected
3857	Xolo Q1200 (White)	marvellous cellstill using ithave to say thoughxolo did a wonderful job bringing so many featured  such an unbelievably cheaper price a samsung with all these ftswud cost at least 1820 grand love my cellthe memory s gud the camera s gud the processing speed s awesome the phone never hangsunlike othersppl keep seeing it n asking bout it and they cannot believe it when i tell them that its a local company xolo and not some hotshot international brand like iphone or samsung or htc
3858	Xolo Q1200 (White)	this phone heats up too much even till 50 degree battery temp very inferior quality battery it got swelled up in less than two months to the extent that the screen came off from the right side of the phone design looks good but it is not fit for xolo to manufacture nonremovable battery phones because if the battery swell up the whole phone gets damaged also if i was asked to pay for the battery and services though the phone and its accessories are still under warranty there are several software issues in this phone mediatek hardware are not meant for good performance it seems this phone has bad audio quality in headphones no matter how good your headphones are xolos headphones are of inferior chinese quality also company promised kitkat update in july first week and till now it hasnt arrived yet september is about to start also the worst part just pray that you dont have to visit any xolo service center in india you are going to have a mental disturbance and sense of loss worst ever services also for the minor issues like replacing battery they take more than 35 days that too is not guaranteed xolo should work on its customer care services they are very rude and unprofessional i would not recommend xolo at all instead you must buy any already well established brands pay a little more but you would enjoy the services xolo is like beauty but with less life and low brains also xolo care is too slow and sluggish xolo care doesnt really care
3859	Xolo Q1200 (White)	simply amazing never hang till from 3 months suparb heat up little after playing vedios or playing game more than 2 hours  but its amazing
3860	Xolo Q1200 (White)	in this price its a good one cam quality is too good u can buy this mobile with out any doubt

3867	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	its a not bad phone i bought  this phone to my dad 1 battery back was good 810 2 display  not up to the mark poor visibility in sun light and viewing angles was bad   510 3 performance wise its was good able to handle games like asphalt subway etc without any lags with class 10 memory card  910 4 touch response was not bad  but isnt good its just average  610 5 camera quality was average in day light and very bad in average light conditions like evengings  times  510 6 no light sensor no proximity sensor 7 no equalizers and no dolby sound effects in music player  510 8 not able to play 720p videos 610 9 browsing experience and page rendering  in ie not up to the mark 610 10 sound was so loud and phone had mono speaker but very good in clarity  1010   overall good phone for basic users and dont expect much from this price range
3868	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	writing after using it for a weekgreat phone for user experiencewindows 81 is very fluid and smooththe screen is also good and doesnot have any problemsthe only cons is the camera and battery which are averageotherwise a great phone for this price rangego for it
3869	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	bought it for my mom and its performed mance is awesome the touch responsiveness is awesome and has most fun appsbought it during the diwali dhamaka sale and got it for the best price as wellif your budget is around rs 5000 look no furtherjust book it
3870	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	the phone is really fast but out of the box syncing to my corporate mailbox did not happen through microsofts company portal software after multiple resets updates and calling microsoft support it still did not work  beware of microsoft support i called them three times and each time was told something else by the person who answered the call one person said that apps are not working because my microsoft account has a gmail id yes you heard that right however even after almost a month of raising a technical ticket i have not heard back from microsoft support when they were supposed to find a resolution within 24 hours i am glad i returned the phone  i now have a lumia 920 which works flawlessly
3871	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	i purchased this phone on recommendation from friends and after reading the reviews initially it looked great as i was using windows phone for the 1st time however the i think the phone i got has some loops in it it hangs sometimes that i have to  take out the battery to reuse it properly the phone is just 2 weeks old and facing this issue 34 times is really irritating also the music stops automatically while listing through earphones and have to plug unplug the wire to get the music this is really irritating i am trying to get in touch with amazon to get it replaced
3872	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	amazon delivery was a little late but the wait was worth it though i just love this phone very responsive touch amazing network compatibility no one can beat nokia in this regard the cons are cannot play 720p smoothlywhile asus zenfone 4 a400cg can play 1080p smoothly at this price battery backup is just satisfactory but this brand at this price i really think if you want a windows phone at this price you gotta get it
3873	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	i write this review after using lumia 530 for abt 3 months  good size and easy to handle battery backup is good even with 512mb ram i can able to play almost blue ray videos with suitable media players good sound most worst thing is that lumia have no app senders all apps must be downloaded from store in bluetooth sending individual file a reception is required no mp3 can be sent via whatsapp
3874	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	cant expect more than that for the price meets all my needs office mails navigation office apps messaging  good battery life
3875	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	a good priced windows ph buyed it for just 5555 which is great but it cant play full hd video properly and also it has no front camera and flash which is bad but rest is gudand one thing is more that i got a defective piece in which ear speaker is not working  so i had to take it for service center and got back after 7days and now works properly giving 3 stars only for price
3876	Nokia Lumia 530 (Dual SIM, Grey)	the main apps i needed were there  pros 8226 doesnt lag can play asphalt 8subway surferstemple runetc 8226support upto 128 gb card 8226 good touch response 8226 a snapdragon with quad core 8226 can watch movies  cons 8226battery life 8226 heats up quickly while charging 8226 no equalizer in the music app  but its okay in such a small price tag

3923	Micromax Canvas Turbo A250 (Pristine White)	i have rated this phone with 4 starsand it is a 4 starer phone  cons   1 if your screen is locked and you end a call you cant unlock it immediately at the end of the call there is a lag of 10 seconds or so this is if the phone is on the blow or shake to unlock mode most irritating thing i found  2 heats up with games like wheres my water and temple run not sure what category of games they come under i was very surprised with this  3 hangs often when playing games and apps shut down unexpectedly happened so many times had to delete few apps not sure if app issue or phone issue  4 blow or shake to unlock works just about ok as i have experienced having to blow multiple times and shake seems to not work 8 out of 10 times  5 benchmarking puts the phone in the middle did not see any close competitors in price around it so this phone must be better then them  6 charging the phone takes ages even after close to 2 hrs it was just 88 done from 99 to 100 just takes forever  now for the pros   1 extremely sleek and light for a 200 mahmp battery phone  2 no fingerprints on the back does not slip and feels extremely comfortable in hand  3 the camera pics have amazing clarity even the front cam takes excellent pics  5 the quality of accessories is awesome flat cables for datacharging cable and the headphones they are also in ear type not used the headphones so cant say about the quality  6 speaker phone quality is decent  7 the touch is very smooth and i did not see any lag
3924	Micromax Canvas Turbo A250 (Pristine White)	30 oct 2013 nice phone but wow factor missing  ok this is my first android i was using lumia 610 before this finding android complex may be just need getting use to it i am sure people here would want to know the cons more than the pro so i start with cons and will tell you the pros then  cons   1 if your screen is locked and you end a call you cant unlock it immediately at the end of the call there is a lag of 10 seconds or so this is if the phone is on the blow or shake to unlock mode most irritating thing i found  2 heats up with games like wheres my water and temple run not sure what category of games they come under i was very surprised with this  3 hangs often when playing games and apps shut down unexpectedly happened so many times had to delete few apps not sure if app issue or phone issue  4 blow or shake to unlock works just about ok as i have experienced having to blow multiple times and shake seems to not work 8 out of 10 times  5 benchmarking puts the phone in the middle did not see any close competitors in price around it so this phone must be better then them  6 charging the phone takes ages even after close to 2 hrs it was just 88 done from 99 to 100 just takes forever  now for the pros   1 extremely sleek and light for a 200 mahmp battery phone  2 no fingerprints on the back does not slip and feels extremely comfortable in hand  3 the camera pics have amazing clarity even the front cam takes excellent pics  5 the quality of accessories is awesome flat cables for datacharging cable and the headphones they are also in ear type not used the headphones so cant say about the quality  6 speaker phone quality is decent  7 the touch is very smooth and i did not see any lag  thats it i expected this phone to make me go wow as this is my first smart phone and i had spent days reviewing other phones in the same price range but it did not happen however this phone appealed to me more than any other and i am pretty confident i did not make the wrong choice at its price i seriously doubt any other phone could match up to it
3925	Micromax Canvas Turbo A250 (Pristine White)	the phone is just awesome buy it with closed eyes youll love it  no issues in last 10 days of using it absolutely reccomended
3926	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	with 12ghz dual core snapdragon processor and windows phone 8 ui is fast people have to use windows phones to know the difference btw android and windows phone 8  why i went for lumia 625  ease of use  good call quality  longer talktime  decent camera  here maps and offline navigation  47inch ipslcd screen decent quality for the price  fast ui thanks to windows phone 8 faster than many android phones under 20k  offical indian apps like irctc hdfc state bank freedom sbi app bookmyshow redbus dominos pvr cinemas moneycontrol my airtel mpassport seva bsnl paytm mapmyindia and so on are available more apps are added to windows phone platform daily give it some time to grow
3927	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	people complaining about this being a waste of money firstly the price was high at the time of launch that is the case with every new product now it has been priced reasonably  few reasons the price is higher that lumia 720 8226full hd 1080p video recording on lumia 625 as opposed to hd 720p on lumia 720 8226puremotion screen with 60hz refresh rate found otherwise only on the 920925 and 1020 it does lack clearblack display though and also glance screen feature isnt supported 8226nokia music subscription is for 6 months with lumia 625 and 3 months on lumia 720 8226lumia 625 is 4g ready lumia 720 supports only 35g at the most 8226lumia 625 has a faster processor 12ghz dualcore than lumia 720 1ghz dualcore this results in smoother overall performance 8226lumia 625 comes with nokia amber update preinstalled and bluetooth 40 preenabled 8226most obvious point the screen on lumia 625 is larger than that on lumia 720  and yes lumia 625 has fm radio some people have wrong info  yes the lumia 720 has better cameras and supports wireless charging but you need to understand that a product can only provide you so much in the price you pay for it and no product is perfect there are always some people who may not like the product but at least please dont misguide others so next time before cursing anything and questioning some companys commitment please do your research properly  thanks
3928	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	i have purchased this phone on 6 oct and today is 27 oct it works fine no lags didnt hang at all lots of apps which are required for everyday use are in store download and enjoy camera works goodtake good pics lenses also available its written in the specification of amazonin that the phone os is windows 8 and upgradable to windows 81 its true and one thing to notice is that its already had windows 81 os cyan update installed  so i dont have to updateupgrade it on my own auto brightness works well if youre a windows phone lover or want something different from android or other os youll love this phone too this phone got everything you want in a smartphone with apps that are needed  amazon service is good as they say the phone was actually delivered in 1 day  at the end i want to say this phone will look good in your hand will fulfill your smartphone needs and its 4g ready i would suggest to buy this phone
3929	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	general takeaway  hi dear consumers like me i have purchased this phone recently on a great deal from my friend getting straight to the point its one of the best phones when bought at 8999 currently if it exceeds 12k again dont bother coming to this mobile as i feel moto g 2nd gen is the best in that price with better features and most importantly stunning on screen picture quality  ecosystem  i am a owner of 3 different and major mobile os platforms ios android  windows os now i recommend this phone to those who dont give a damn about the number of apps present in the app store as windows store currently has only the famous social media apps available believe me you dont have google maps but there is nokia maps which comes on board and does a decent replacement job free ms office apps like word excel power point  guess what outlook  user experience  i personally loved this phone with a steady os running on it never seen lags till date and was very refreshing for eyes to ones that got used to ios  android theres a secret that nokia kept us away from i observed floating touch on this phone the reason could be i was hot  its the principle behind capacitive touch screen i felt the screen resolution is on a lower end end when you watch videos and pixels break easily and visible to eyes thats only the biggets disappointment i guess as a phone priced at 17k mrp should have got its most visible part correct d camera is the hidden upsleeve trick it has one of the burst photo modes and you will love it pease update to 81 as soon as you have this phone its really better than 8 and for a better user experience the background theme is really superb d  my final call if you are a person of patience then you really have to wait for the next gen lumia phones like 730 at this price range otherwise at current price 8999 its definitely a deal you will not regret any time soon
3930	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	with 12ghz dual core snapdragon processor and windows phone 8 ui is fast people have to use windows phones to know the difference btw android and windows phone 8  why i went for lumia 625  ease of use  good call quality  longer talktime  decent camera  here maps and offline navigation  47inch ipslcd screen decent quality for the price  fast ui thanks to windows phone 8 faster than many android phones under 20k  offical indian apps like irctc hdfc state bank freedom sbi app bookmyshow redbus dominos pvr cinemas moneycontrol my airtel mpassport seva bsnl paytm mapmyindia and so on are available more apps are added to windows phone platform daily give it some time to grow

3932	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	great phonefor my purposes well done nokia arrived on 2 jan 2015 and am loving it pros excellent build quality 1 of the best   good performance with just 512 mb ram   great battery back up  almost 2 days with normal usage with wifi on   awesome touch response super sensitive touch   even with low resolution display is good n bignokia smartly made the text softer so tat there is no pixelation   camera is good not great but you can enhance pictures taken with brilliant nokia apps cons only con as of now is lack of clear black display final verdict if ur not a heavy gamer and want a windows phone with all basic features just go for itif ur budget is low otherwise go for 730 nd dnt go for 535
3933	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	ive been an ios fan all my life decided to shift to windows phone for a change pros very responsive touch no lag like android good screen much better than hd screens of xolo and micromax in my opinion good battery life no heating problems hd video good camera very big screen build quality far superior to any android phone in that range be it samsung or xperia or lenovo or micromax the phone is solid and built like a tank cons really poor ecosystem very few apps are available those available are too bad visavis android or ios  verdict good phone for money solid built nice colours and decent camera if you are like me and want a smart phone with office suite facebook and twitter little bit of gaming look no further  ps after 12 hours of use the phone just died on me the touch became unresponsive returned it free of cost and got a replacement lumia it runs just fine
3934	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	in this phone all features are good but i m not able to decrease volume in music player when i on call at that time i will be able to decrease volume  so please check it if anyone has solution please put your thougt
3935	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	pros fast ui no lags like android very good touch pretty decent battery  with moderate use of 3g  wifi it lasts me for 15 days  i never play games  online videos thoughnokia mix radio is awsomei got this at unbelievable prices in sale  so certainly value for money seems a premium piece in your hands  cons this os is yet to mature in user friendliness to the level of android  while snoozing the alarm it doesnt asks us for time to snooze for just snoozes by 10 mins flat sometimes youtube videos crash with decode error
3936	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	great screen super fast ui big display good camera all in all great value for money good color options i chose green all the covers can be changed
3937	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	good smart phone at 9k used android phone for over 3 years initially thought of buying the muchhyped chinese smart phones which were later found out to be overheating i am very much happy with my selection of this branded phone  after 2 weeks of use pros nice look and feel ample screen size upgraded the phone to 81 with no issues photos quality is good not overheating after extended use of gaming and listening to music battery backup is fair enough sometimes lasting more than 2 days after switching off the location service  cons had issues with transferring contacts tried the inbuilt transfer application converting vcf to csv and then synching with gmail etc finally 34phone swappr34 application which is available in both android and wp saved my day  512 mb ram seems to be enough so far for this windows os as i am not a heavy game user dint hesitate buying this phone able to play real speed car racing game without any lag
3938	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	wp8  first of all talking about the wp8 that is the only thing that would give a little drawback to the phone windows phone os is just a growing software it needs improvement in many respects few examples would be swipe type extensive customization app availability but i would say the interface is pretty fast compared to a slow hanging android os till now i couldnt install apps into sd card which in fact fills out my phone memory available 4gb so basically i cant download movies using the youtube app or movies app  battery this is one reason why i like this phone pretty much i usually get a 2024 hrs life with 3g internet always onexcept sleeptime 7 hrs otherwise id get a 3644 hrs with normal usage thats pretty good compared to samsung phones and other phone is lumia series  build quality  excellent as it caused no visible damage as ive clumsily dropped it to hard floor atleast 56 times but take it to be granted compared to lumia 520 and 720 it has a better build quality  music xp  produces good quality music using the wh 208  the music app lets you download millions of songs  if your sd card allows you to for free for six months after that you could renew the nokia music acc gotta try out with my new sennheiser hd 439 it also fares well with nokia bh111  nokia camera  the app pretty much allows you to learn various aspects of digital photography the camera is pretty good but not as good as the one in my prev htc one v zooming on kills the photo clarity but without zoom it does a good job k  the phone calls out to be a nokia product in every manner
3939	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	after diverted to other brand finaly i got my favorite brand as lumia 625 i have ordered this on diwali  very much happy with this no lagging as android look is good no worry about aplications all essential apps are available in window store touch sensitivity best camera good i do all my official mails whatsapp facebook with this battery back up is good  fast charging some peoples says that no so much apps in windows i think except some usefull apps nobody use hundreds of apps after a month of byeing the phone
3940	Nokia Lumia 625 (Black)	i got a great deal  just 7k on dhanteras sale though the dilivery was goofed up and i had to order twice to get it dilivered amazon call centre and the dilivery people have absolutely no cordination i was given a tracking id of gati courier which didnt work on the courier website mobile is average but with above price it has become exceptional love the mixradio its best app i have ever come across the platfoms in india with microsoft lumia 535 round the corner this one is having its last breaths

3968	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	first of all if you are a loyalist of samsung and apple so please stay away from the review cause youll be disappointed by your such loyal brands i have used iphonesnote series 2n3s3s4nokia lumia and also some htc phones i would like to say when it comes to stock androidnexus 5 and motos are best but they cost you around 30k for their flagship and if you want flagship with stock android you can go for nexus 6 only i know its an old model by sony but specs are like launched just recent and not so far first i would like to tell you this baby is a beast or can we say it a monsteroh yeahyou got it right a monster first talk about sammy i dont know why samsung is selling its flagships over 50k and giving us a lot much disappointing product like an example note 3 which is a very good smartphone in any case but when it comes to performance it hangs sometimes when background running apps are left my brother have one and he says i will sell it off and such a crap phone did you know samsung is cheating indian consumers by selling cheap exynos processor in themsame note 3 in us is retailing there with snapdragon 800 chipset and lte samsung has became greedy now now coming to apple just think will you get a 1080p display with a high quality sd800 quadcore processor and waterproofing with a name sony no no no answer is clearly no in apple or any big brand loyalists of apple are getting home a premium quality good looking standard phone with lack of much much performance if you have that kind of money you can buy a z3 without anyones opinion  believe me youll be delighted to have it i know it doesnt have the software like apple but believe me android experience is much better it runs on a phone of 4k to 60k and they have their own interface haters will hate if you wanna buy iphone so can buy it for sure no problem but you will be missing performance you deserveanyway now we all are familiar with specs of the phone and if not you can read it above mentioned on the site nothing diffrent than written on the website now coming to the components and specs definition processor a snapdragon 800 chipset with krait 400 quad core processor clocked at 22ghz each what else you want in a sub margin of 20k if you want latest specs with less price or few more price you can go with brands like oneplus one and lenovo who offer better specs at just 23k diffrence the phone doesnt hang after installing a hell of applications well this chipset is fast even it is old the sd805 is out now and sony will be launching sd810 in its z4 tablet ram better than s4 didnt let the phone to hang unlike all samsung phones even with 3gigs ram are continously lagging machines but always 60 ram is used and this lead to power consumption of battery displayone word onlyexcellent yes you heard that right its excellenta very great 19201080p display with 342ppi density colors are great not like the note 3 which produces fake mostly fake colors watching movies in 1080p resolution is world got transformed into the eyes yes its outstanding speaker not much loud like htc with boomsound due to waterproofing but it do give audio close to htc boomsound and very clear audio yep there is only one speaker in the bottom but it is loud enough after all you wont use it as a loudspeaker in a party but when you connect speakers to it it gives mind boggling sound im surprised by the headphones sony packed with em they are only bass boosters not much beats found when listning thank god i have philips she3590bl headset which gives awesome sound build quality a nice build quality but im afraid of cracking the screen as mentioned in many reviews the body is made of hard shatter proof glass in papers but some people listed it cracks for no reason so ive bought a tempered hard scratch proof glass screen for my phone and that is 33mm thick youll need a jack hammer to break it magnetic dock dk30 freeyes sony gives magnetic dock free with the phone but only which are packed with latest imports about the dockit is good to charge wirelessly your phone and protect its flaps from wear and tear for waterproofing flip coversony is no more giving flip cover with latest imported product i got the dock charger which is more valuable than muvit 6700 bucks flip cover gamesan adreno 330 which is used in nexus 5 also a good experience of gaming till date no lags in playing asphalt and dungeon hunter appssony packs small apps which are useful as well as their signed apps which are available on google play are pre installed interfacemuch closer to stock android of motorola and nexus im on kitkat 444 and about to recieve lollipop the kitkat update came sealed in the box due to latest imports web browsinggood netwoking with 3g on all day with stamina mode battery backupnice but not the best after all for such huge screen battery is not sufficient only 3050mah when screen is on it consumes 70 of the phones power charging is fast and stamina mode is brilliant when i left the phone over night with 3g on it was only 75 and when i put it on next day it was 73 remaining stamina mode also let us keep the apps aside which will get data services even after screen is turned off camera as you know the worst things are putted at downside only really worst 8mp camera ive ever seen even moto g2 have 8mp but clicks very nice picturesthere are pixels roaming on the screen while capturing in indoors while outdoors it gives pretty decent pics in daylight only front camera is good for video chat just sayingive purchased the phone from authorised sony dealer and got the magnetic dock free and also got the latest imported and packed product with latest updates so no complaint with that for 19k i think its a stealand due to self cracking screen rumours ive also purchased insuarance of syska worth rs1299 bucks on their online website i know the online sites are selling it with lesser price but they are giving the phone with price written 46990 and mine with latest import has 20990 and it has dock charger free strongest competitors of this phone with the price and their pros and cons htc desire 820 display is

flash and can capture pics in daylight also i have nikon digicam so i dont need phone camera m not a camera scker oh i didnt mentioned that the screen is huge but i get used to it in 12 hour and now the phone is just fine to hold once you will get used to this phoneall other phones like s4 and grand will be a kiddie for you this is the biggest screen phone in the world right now  thanx for

3969	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	i bought the black one about a month back this is a year old model a bit too early for its time perhaps this was sonys flagship last year but didnt sell much sony is clearing the stock before bringing the next generation out and hence the pricecut last month which makes it a mouthwatering prospect and youre wondering whether to fall for it well i did and so far im loving it  there are enough reviews on the net so ill quickly let you know the pros and cons   the screen is super sharp great for watching movies or reading books   its big enough to read books in the proper format but also portable so reading while holding in one hand is comfortable for quite a while also its small enough to carry around in your pocket albeit large ones fits a jacket pocket like a glove   talking with the phone held to your ear is very inconvenient as expected bluetooth works perfectly its aptx compatible can transmit stereo audio   takes a micro sd card up to 64gb storage is not an issue   can be used as a proper phone unlike some tablets with  without voice calling skype etc work perfectly on both data and wifi   battery life is decent gets me through the day easily with moderate to high usage i do have the stamina mode on which is recommended for a secondary device   processor is a beast will play any game or movie you throw at it has enough ram and other specs to be relatively future proof   camera is ok in bright light absolutely useless in the dark do not get this if you care about taking pictures   sound is good through the earphones horrible through the mono loudspeaker really sony no stereo on a flagship   sony though has promised the android l update for the z ultra and i will hold sony to its promise until proven otherwise should get the latest and greatest android by early 2015   i also received a wonderful flip cover free with it which was a surprise because i didnt notice it being mentioned anywhere on the amazon listing page thanks to whoever was responsible for including it   when i started the phone for the first time there was a horrible yellow tint in the screen but sony had addressed this issue earlier through firmware updates and the phone will automatically take you through a couple of android iterations it will then allow you to change the white balance and i prefer a blueish tinge which was easy enough to set with the newfound controls   oh and before i forget the phones dust proof and water resistant build quality is superb far better than any tablet or phablet in this price range looks beautiful in the included flip cover looks wise its worthy of a 4550k phone which is what it was launched for last year  all in all its a great media consumption device with the pricecut it has suddenly become very good value compared to say the nexus 7 but would i recommend it as a phone i would hesitate doing that if this is going to be your primary device its a great secondary device by far the best that youll get in this category and price range i love it because its easy to carry all the leisure stuff around plus i can also get some work done in a pinch i particularly love the wonderful screen that makes reading and browsing a pleasure five stars at the current price of 20k get it before sony clears all the stock
3970	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	dont brought mobile from heera digitals i have booked one sony xperia z ultra on 15112014 and i have received mobile on 17112014 morning at 1045 i felt happy that movement but the pack is not packed properly there is no amazon tape seal on that and just a plastic cover packed and sent after opening the mobile i felt so much angry and so much disappoint that the mobile what i received is used one by seeing visually we can easily say its a used one how amazon allowed like this i got surprised following are the identified proofs to say its a used one 01 in charging point there is no cover 02 scratches are clearly visible on edge of the phone 03 dust clearly visible in edge gaps of the phone 04 generally sealed mobile does not have screen protecteronly they will give temporary screen guard but its had screen guard with out peeling not a temporary screen guard 05when i enquired in my near by sony mobile shop they told new piece does have back  side screen guard but it had screen guard 06 in mobile edges dust visually appears how negligence that the vendor to send used one  how amazon allowing this type of fraud vendors  after receipt of mobile on 17112014 immediately i posted returned request on 17112014 after request amazon sent return conformation on 18112014 at 1500 approximatelythen immediately i taken returned label print and packed very well amazon vendor sent only in cover but i packed in very securely in box and covered with plaster tomorrow 19112014 i am going to post it to vendor  while i received the mobile on pack only available from and to address and india post label nothing other is there but when i want to return it  they require handle with care label to whom it may be label every thing what is this rules yar  when the situation i seen the mobile i got so angry on amazon and vendor how much neglect on customers i thought to file police case and to put in consumer court but not done that amazon need to be think on this how ur approved vendors doing fraudulent activities
3971	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	great product at an unbelievable price i also received a free flip case worth 2990 z ultra is a beast when it comes to big screen experience and snapdragon 800 is still a wicked fast chipset although snapdragon 805 is out now and waterproofing just puts a great big cherry on the cake just go for it you wont find more competitive product at this price from a recognised brand
3972	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	i must mention the time i purchased this device i saved more than 6000 rupees by ordering it from amazonin  re about device it is a sony product no doubt it is the best device in its class great 1080 display great performance and excellent features
3973	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	best in this price range but screen is not scratch proof and flash is not available
3974	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	product is from july 2013 the product seal was tampered and another hologram was affixed over it a number of freebies are mentioned in box but none were provided returning immediately for refund   avoid seller  digital store
3975	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	i rarely write 5 star reviews for gadgets but this device deserves every last star it can get before i get to the meat there are a few caveats  1 i bought the phone at 837723000 when it was retailing for around 30k at the time of the review amazon was selling it for a shade short of 837720k  2 i use it more for playing games using it as my online shopping device and occasionally for calling  3 i bought it with my eyes open i knew it didnt have a flash and i am never a sucker for phone cameras or for that matter any camera  4 the stats mentioned below are with stamina mode enabled however many apps were give permission to sync whatsapp telegram ebay gmail and amazon  5 i use it mostly indoors so the weak performance of the screen outdoors isnt a problem for me  now the review  i am an avid tech user i overclock my pcs use custom roms in most of my devices have a jailbroken ipad and the z ultra is rooted but with the stock rom and by heavens does it impress  battery under moderate usage 3g always on it gives me a screen time of close to 5hrs 4h57m and chugs along for 3 days without complaint before the battery warning pops up  from a 100 to 15 on just standby with about 30 mins of screen time 3g always on it lasted a week  gaming  the snapdragon 800 series and 2gb ram do a fantastic job i never tried any of those racing games but playing hitman go and leos fortune simultaneously while being on whatsapp and about 10 other apps running in the background never slowed the device  hitman go  leos fortune  monument valley marathons saw the device buckle and beg for power in 3hrs not fantastic but with a 3000mah battery i will put that under impressivei use a note 3 which i wish showed such resilience  looks  always loved the device and still continue to do so after 4 months of use each time i hold it sans its flip case i marvel at this gorgeous slab  build quality  absolutely no complaints in fact after having used it i am seriously considering gifting myself the z2 tablet looks like it is going to happen very shortly  updates  from being a sony hater now i have become a very vocal supporter i am running android 444 and sony has promised a lollipop update to all its z devices agreed it might be some time in the coming but it surely is  the cons  1not much love from xda interms of custom roms 2 tap to wake is desperately needed 3 mushy power button taken care of by the mikey 4 insanely well made makes you want to hold it quite often  at 20 big ones it is a steal buy buy buy
3976	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	this has to be my best tech purchase this year got it for a great deal rs18680 amazon fulfilled and this phone is worth every penny spent like they say someones pain is someone elses gain so those who widely panned the z ultra for its sheer size and impracticality forced sony to give it away for a massive discount of less than half its original price around rs45000 for content junkies like me the size was a boon and slipping it into my chinos was never a problem thanks to its ultra slim profile in slimskinny jeans it is bit of a tight fit but still never unmanageable girls may have reasons to crib given their shallow jeans pockets but guys should do just fine  this phone was ahead of its time when it was launched in 2013 and it is still pretty relevant even mid2015 its real world performance is pretty much up with the current flagships so it is bargain at this price similar speced snapdragon 800 devices from tier 1 companies like samsung htc nokia lumia 1520 etc are still selling around the 35k mark  anyways here is my take on the pros and cons of the z ultra  pros  1 snapdragon 800 22ghz quad core 2 gb ram adreno 330 16 gb inbuilt storage and expandable memory these are flagship comparable specs at a bargain price of under rs20k  2 super gorgeous and massive 64 full hd 1080p screen with one of the best color gamuts out there the colors just pop thanks to sonys xreality and mobile bravia 2 engine which do a great job of rendering brilliant colors it will bring a smile on your face every time you turn on the screen im coming from a samsung note ii and being used to the brilliant blacks on the amoled panel of the note ii i was not expecting the z ultras triluminous display to wow me exactly but boy how wrong i was the xreality does a great job of making the blacks the darkest out there almost comparable to amoled panels and the whites are just so much brighter and better than amoled  even though the screen is massive the individual pixels are absolutely not discernible to the eye hd movies just pop photos look gorgeous reading on the device is a pleasure and games render beautifully thanks to the more than capable adreno 330 which is also employed in the one plus one and many other flagship devices overall i can say i couldnt be more satisfied with the quality of the z ultras screen  3 3050 mah battery is more than enough for a day and half sometimes 2 full days with moderate usage heavy users can still churn out a days worth of runtime from the battery and sonys brilliant battery optimization feature called stamina and ultra stamina mode gives me 65 hours of screen on time on lollipop which is pretty good by all means  4 the build is impeccable the phone is ip58 certified for being dust proof and water resistant upto 15 meters for 30 minutes the piece of shatter proof glass slab in the front and back and the aluminium chassis to hold it all together give it a premium feel which is such a far cry from the squeaky plasticky samsungs of yore there are absolutely no squeaks from any where in the device and it just feels like a solid piece of metal slab in the hand i call bs on some people saying the glass cracks on its own unless you subject it to impractical and undue pressure or are just carelessly throwing it around on your desk i dont see that happening this device looks every bit like its built to last and well did i mention at 65mm this is just sexy slim   5 official lollipop update 502 already available for z ultra even though i hate lollipop and the overall material design with whites spread everywhere this could be a plus point for you i much loved the dark sony themed kitkat on z ultra anyways the device has taken to lollipop very well apart from the occasional hiccups which are inherent with lollipop across all flagship devices the performance is stutter free and smooth  6 sonys clearaudio dsp and walkman app is second to none in audio quality i can hear way more detail in my music than i ever could with my note 2  7 the bundled earphones are pretty darn good when travelling and i use a grado sr80e when at home i couldnt be more satisfied with the sound quality   8 network performance is great and i havent faced dropped calls and people on the other side said they could hear me loud and clear  9 newer imports are coming with the charging dock which is immensely useful if you do not want to open the charging lid everytime unfortunately back when i had purchased in january it was coming with a flip cover from muvit which although useful to keep your device safe isnt as great an accessory as the current bundled magnetic dock  10 you can use any felttip pen or pencil as a stylus with the device and draw to your hearts content on the expansive screen canvas take notes  etc no dedicated stylus needed like the note series from samsung  cons 1 the 8 mp primary camera is not the highlight of this device it is decent but not great even then with lollipop the photo quality has improved drastically from kitkat days it has more to do with sonys photo processing than the lens itself as the same exmor rs is used on a lot other flagship devices which take brilliant pictures flash is missing as well im not really a shooter so i couldnt care less the front cam at 2mp is good for selfies again marred by sonys photo processing maybe in future updates it will be fixed see attached image for quality of photo its not too bad honestly  2 loudspeaker is not loud enough with lollipop sony for some unexplained reason did away with xloud which did a good job of enhancing the loudspeaker ear piece output so you have to carefully choose the right ringtone so that you hear it out on the streets hopefully xloud will be reimplemented in updates coming up  3 the charging port sim slot microsd slot etc are all under lids to keep the device water resistant so it could be an annoyance opening and closing the lid everytime to charge but believe me you get used to it pretty soon and it doesnt bother anymore  4 size as mentioned earlier could be an issue to some in daily use  5 although this is more of a current trend and not really a con i have to mention that the battery is not userreplaceable  6 the black one is a fingerprintmagnet  i guess that covers my take on this awesome device im every bit satisfied with the z ultra and would recommend this phone wholeheartedly to anyone who is okay with the size also i couldnt be more satisfied with the overall buying experience thanks to amazon fulfilled and teckihome seller
3977	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	great phone one can use this phone as 1 phone 2tablet 3 tv 4 pc 5 chopping vegetables 6 plate for eating food  all in one great phone

3983	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	be prepared to charge your phone often
3984	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	accidental protection is withdrawn and phone is irreparable better buy other companiens handsets i had to pay rs 18495 just for glass crack google for cracked sony handsets i would have given minus 5 stars if it would have been possible
3985	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	the best mobile i owned till now it offers so much with that cost i havent seen any mobile company to put these many features in a single device  pros  1 22 ghz quad core 800 series snapdragon processor  multitasking and hing end gaming is so smooth and lag free 2 display is awesome watching movies and video is a pleasure 3 great for listening music 4 1 year subscription free for mcafee antivirus 5 free ebooks in flipkart 6 unlimited xperia storage 7 good call quality wifi bluetooth speeds 8 great ui 9 support with sony sndroid smartware and other z brand xperia privilleges  it almost covers what a phone should offer in terms of quality and performance i should be an extreme critic to  list down these cons 1 camera quality is good but no flash thats okay because still you get great pictures in daylight 2 till you get used to it s huge size you find it uneasy to handle the calls without bluetooth  3 cons
3986	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	a beast labelled sony at its head a milestone phone from the sony  with extravagant display which surely take a dig on the iphone named overrated crap but on the other side you will surely gonna miss the lack of flash on the rear but according to me it depends on head to head which on my case the flash hardly matters above all it encases a snapdragon processor of 22ghz which handles the data flow with ease and another advantage of this is that the technology integrated by the sony in this will not lag from others in coming 2 years so who want to buy the phone for a long run  this is it camera is a bit disappointment but satisfied  now coming to the design section the glass factor on front and rear is an eyecandy which also complements the triluminious hd displayand believe me when you enjoy the movies on the phone by keeping it on the dock stand the phone is no less than the bravia  according to me the phone belongs to the audience who do not travel much but surely consider this phone when tyou are making your wish list
3987	Sony Xperia Z Ultra (Black)	value for money mobile for gamers and browsing  pros sony design superb looks and build very good chipset to handle anything in playstore value for money18k waterproof and dustproof also optimised software  so no heating or crashing issues magnetic charger is a bonus but no flip cover very good dynamic sound quality its walkman but volume is low and cant drive higher end headphones properly very good battery life max 2 days and min 8 to 10 hrs usb otg support and led indicator present camera has lot options and features headphone jack is at side so that we can hold it  in both hands while gaming or watching movies very nice design  cons too big to use and handle as mobile phone in daily life there is serious issue with screen in showing darker pictures or in movies you have to set brightness its full while watching movies to use it i think there is problem in grey scale also sony is using some tech in screens back illumination which automatically adjust itself according the pictures showing on screen to conserve battery and to show deep blacks i think this tech is not perfect till now while showing darker areas in pictures or movies avearge camera with no flash built in speaker is one of the worst i have seen by sony volume is low and quality also low better use headphones only  this is for people who want both phone and tab in one

3992	Xolo Q3000 (White)	xolo q3000 is the latest flagship device from xolo powered by a mediatek turbo processor  here are some featurespros and cons  1 dual sim  one is mini simother one is micro sim 2 huge 57inch fhd 1080p ips display 3 mediatek mtk6589 turbo processor clocked at 15ghz this same processor is seen in canvas magnuswhich is rs 7000 lesser it would have been great if they had this powered with a powerful qualcomm processor instead 4 2 gb ram 5 head phones coming with it are not inear ones a flip coverscreen guard and an otg cable are included in the box 6 huge battery  4000mah such a powerful one is necessary since it has a huge 1080p screen it can last 2 days of average use 7 accelerometer magnetometer ambient light sensor gyroscope and proximity sensors on board 8 camera  rear camera is goodbut not that greatfront cam is quite good for video calling in good light 9 421 jellybean  thats pretty old now hopefully this will get kitkat update unlike other indian brandsxolo is quite good at giving ota updates 10 benchmarks are similar to other mtk6589 turbo devices like micromax turbomicromax magnus etc  quadrant score  4700 antutu score  15000  overall a great value for money device and hopefully the price will come down to 17k18k in a few weeks
3993	Xolo Q3000 (White)	i have been using this device for 1 month and here is my experience i am a big fool because even after reading so many bad reviews about xolo q3000 i purchased it but i do not have any complaint about amazon service it is just fantastic i got the device within 24 hours after ordering without paying even single rupee extra  display is very nice and crystal clear as it is full hd display device is really fast and never hangs design is also nice  now here are the issues build quality is not good back cover is very thin speaker quality is poor camer is 13 mp but it is equivalent to 5 mp camera of branded mobile micromax 8 mp camera is even better than xolo camera power button issue sometime power button doesnt work so it is not possible to lock the device by pressing power button after some time this issue gets resolved automatically very unstable network coverage it gets changed frequently and really poor reception when there is no network coverage device gets unlocked automatically in pocket and starts dialing emergency numbers it seems software issue i have kitkat 442 when we start video camera device gets  overheated so video camera can not be used for more than 3 to 4 minutes device also gets overheated when you play hd games on it it works perfect for normal play store games when call is going on device automatically start wifi gps bluetooth and may time put call on hold automatically  i have seen above issue so far and will post if i find any new thing  now service center dont even think to go to xolo service center if you have any problem with your device give it to your children as a toy but do not got to service center because they takes 3 months to send the device to delhi for repairing and they also take 3 more months to repair it i also heard that many people didnt get device back even after a year  so dont get tempted to its bit 57 screen and 2gb ram there are many alternatives for this device in market learn from my experience and never buy xolo products as they have many issues
3994	Xolo Q3000 (White)	good phone with excellent features  reasonable price  xolo q3000 has excellent features compared to other phones in that price range
3995	Xolo Q3000 (White)	the return policy for electronics good is 10days and the phone started acting cranky after 15 days and turns off by itself and i had missed many important calls  problem  1 the phone turns off while charging 2 while charging if you press the lock key the power options pops up and if you press return on that screen the phone restarts and very annoying   reset the phone plenty of times then it works fine for a day and then it just turns of suddenly took it to service center and these is no xolo professionally trained guys to service the phone some local mobile service guys orbit mobile service took the authority to service xolo mobile on the first visit he reset the phone without asking me and i had loose all the data same problem in couple of days gave it to them on friday  20092014 and still they are working im sure they would send it to noida factory for service and i would loose the phone for couple of months  this is my 2nd xolo mobile first a500 which is ok  slow performance but doing its job but i feel its a bad choice though
3996	Xolo Q3000 (White)	those who are all having issues with phone speaker can increase the volume bit more by following the below steps 1 install 34mtk engineering34 from play store 2 open app and select 34mtk settings34 2 under hardware testing tab select audio 4 select loudspeaker mode 5 select type as 34ring34 and set the max vol as max limit allowed if it is 0160 then set 159 6 follow the same step for normal mode sip type 6 please do not disturb anything else in that setting  now check the volume increased bit
3997	Xolo Q3000 (White)	i bought this one for my friend im using xolo q900  i felt better than any other budget phones now in the market first of all it looks so good gives a premium look n feel its highlights are the display qty processor 2gb ram 16gb internal  exp 4000mah battery  much more never feel any lag at any point the only difficulty is to remove the back cover its a 5734 phone yet it feels handy because its really thin  light weight  i recommend you to buy this one if you are planning to buy an hiconfig phone with rate btwn 14k16k always purchase via online for the lowest rate all the best
3998	Xolo Q3000 (White)	why to buy this phone xolo q3000 i brought this phone on 10 oct 2014 with order id  17120676779473138 from amazon amazon delivered product on time however delivery boy do not wait for you more than 10 min if you are not present and also will not inform expected time of delivery at your door step performance   i will give 5 star for smoothness and performance of the phone very good on hd game and movie no hanging or slags ness  battery  battery is not up to the mark as mentioned 4000 mah  equal to the performance of 2450 mah  of samsung and other good branded ph  camera  camera is good only in sunny day sun light camera as mentioned is rear 13 mp but picture quality is below standard of 5 mp of my samsung and even xolo q1010 which is only  8 mp camera performance is better front camera also equal to 2 mp of branded phone like apple samsung htc lg  etc 55 inch screen  great screen make you feel good when you surfing chatting or enjoying online movie but not handy to carry do not get fit in pocket  resolution resolution is high in present market 1920x1080 full hd it mentioned or written on box of mobile but i feel samsung apple htc normal resolution is more clear than this practicallyjust had incresed the digit after sale support  i have not visited xolo service centre till date therefore no comment on it overall  overall an average phone but if you are looking for quality camera or true 13mp than this not the choice 5 star for performance only

4000	Xolo Q3000 (White)	very bad device and after sales support battery takes ages to charge and then doesnt last even for 24 hours camera is 13 mp only for name sake as the picture quality specially closed up image is totally disorted no clarity on ow light very disappointed with the purchase as for software glitch list is endless 1 automatically restart randomly 2 automatically it switches off data connection so always need to start it before surfing internet 3 camera software does not bring intofocus even after multiple tap on d screen 4 frequent drop of cellular network 5 phone gets heated up very quickly 6 worst of all after sales support as they do not take any responsibility of reparing or rectifying issues even afer notifying them over calls as well as over email
4001	Xolo Q3000 (White)	i bought a xolo q3000 white from amazonin the product is good and have many good qualities like fully hd display 2 gb ram 9 gb internal storage for apps and the remaining for other user data 6 inch screen the only two things that dissatisfied me were the draining of battery at a fast rate and the poor sound quality i returned the article and hats off to amazon for refunding the full amount within 3 days hats off to amazon for their services also i would like to bring to your notice the behavior and response of the amazonin executives they were so helping in solving my issues thanks to amazon hr deptt for hiring and training such skilled professionals a sincere request to xolo for upgrading the sound quality of mobile phones and battery life
4002	Xolo Q3000 (White)	feauture wise  function wise this phone is cheaper then any other phone in the indian marketbut the main draw back is its audia is very lowcall sound clearity is very badneed to be improvement  flip cover is very worthlesselse all the  camera hd videobattery is awesome
4003	Xolo Q3000 (White)	pros 1 huge n clear display  gr8 experience while watching hd n full hd movies 2  fast processor and multitasking 3 sound quality is good 4 overall good value for money corns  1 pathetic touch screen experience 2 large n huge size  uncomfortable to carry in ur pockets 3 old android version 421 4 camera quality is not up to the mark 131 mp my old sony xperia 82 mp gives much more clear n sharp pics if u r looking for big clear n sharp display n fast processor then its good to buy i m using it from 1 month but still i hv not experienced  any technical problem 
4004	Xolo Q3000 (White)	the phone has almost everything one except and may be beyond the screen is quite big and resolution is perfect the only drawback i see the speaker volume which impacts video watching without headset and so the reason of one start less else you made a wise decision

4028	Microsoft Lumia 640 XL (Dual SIM, Cyan)	i was in live with this phone the day i saw it at the mwc event so when i was planning on buying a new phone i knew which one to get  pros  premium build quality doesnt feel like a 15k phone the grip is perfect matte finish keeps away stains well rounded edges the finishing is just about perfect  display the display is crisp and works as expected i was worried if a device with such a huge screen would have messed up on the display part but its spot on after playing around in the lumia color profile for a while one can alter the display to hisher liking  camera the camera is great images taken are filled with details the default camera app is a little disappointment but try the lumia camera to see the real deal the default app had some issues with low light images but the lumia camera with rich capture resolved that id suggest going through a youtube tutorial on the lumia camera app to get a hang of how it worksbecause honestly it does get confusing  os this phone features the update 2 of the windows phone 81  the last of its name it is not a major upgrade over its predecessor wp81 or the update 1 but it brings about some welcome features on the table and a variety of bug fixes it is not the best os out there i agree but the wp os offers best value for money on its devices in the lowmid range section with options like direct installation to sd card you could never run out of space given you have a big enough sd card in the two days that ive spent with the phone i already have around 5gb of apps installed on my phone and card also the days when the windows store lacked decent apps are now gone there is a plethora of apps out here on the store and those that arent will hopefully be here by the end of monsoon this year so if the windows tag is stopping you trust me you should get rid of the fear  keyboard quite possibly one of the simplest and effective keyboards across all oses it adapts to your style of writing your words and grows with it the prediction is close to perfection word flow only makes it easier to type also its got a set of in built dictionaries including hinglish so agar aap bhi meri tarah hindi se english me switch karte hain apne conversations me aap ye bina kisi jhigjhig k kar sakte hain  cons  speakers the external speakers arent as great as youd want them to be the ringtones and alarms are audible but could have been louder  charging even though the phone offers excellent battery back up it takes a lifetime for the phone to charge fully the default charger takes about 3 hours to go from 0100 this isnt really a problem because even with 50 battery one still has about a day of moderate to heavy usage left on the phone but for people like me obsessed with fully charged phones you will have to adjust a little  apart from all that the size might take some getting used to especially for people who are used to smaller phones although one handed operation is difficult its still possible for people with big hands  all in all if you are looking for a mid ranger that packs performance with useability and are open to wp go ahead and get this beast if you however love your lags and the phone constantly annoying you with low memory notifications are absolutely fine with topgrade specs that offer the worst possible performance and upgrades that take longer than salmans verdict to arrive you can stick to miphone

4048	Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini A200 (Black)	nice phone for me i purchase this on four months agoit offer a perfect 5mp front camera for selfie it is not much suitable for gamingback camera is lag somerimes in room conditions very good display  and light weight also a thin phone only disadvantage is that it is heat up fastlynot suitable for higher game because of heating but perfommence is perfect 13 ghz processor suitable for this phone1800mah battery is goodcontinous working for 46 hours by using net
4049	Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini A200 (Black)	hello fellow buyers hope my review helps you in purchaseread carefully  first of all i would like to thank amazon india for the lovely appiness day it was truly amazing hope to see such days more often  and secondly for the delivery time u guys are spot on  coming to review it is a good device but i got one with two issues 162the most common issue is screen bleeding the blue spot or line under the screen at bottom tried my best to get rid of the defect myself called up micromax did not help they are worst at customer servicethey flood the market and forget customer satisfaction and support for faulty units if you have one best is to get it returned asap and buy new set hope you will get non bleeding screen  262the battery is actually 1000mah thats what 3 diffrent tests confirmedit supposed to be 1800 mah again micromax did not help and asked me to callup cloudtail the seller  what i liked about device light weight the reason why i bought it and 47inch screen seems to work for me front cam colours and screen minus the defect  dislike rear camera is just average not even good battery is pathetic does not last 4 hours on 3g video call no kitkat update micromax the worst chinese reseller in indiai have heard the same for xolo and karbonn buy these brands  at your riski am at a loss as i invested in premium glass screen guard and cover after so many days of no help from micromax sadly i have initiated return and i will buy it once again will update soon
4050	Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini A200 (Black)	wow what a product this was best phone in such less price the best part of the phone is camera i compared its camera with grand 2 this got the better camera some time it may get lag due to heat if over used
4051	Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini A200 (Black)	in most cases there are two categories in smartphones the below 10000 range and the above 17000 range with a marked difference in their features however this one falls somewhere in between and in fact might just be on the better side of things with the supersleek stylish look lightweightwith inbuilt battery and 47 inch size good battery life too maybe not good enough for a 15000mrp purchase but surely perfect for a reduced dealas i got it for just 6711 on the amazon appiness day on 111114 also one more thing to be noted is that the back colour is grey and not white but thats not much of a worry as it is a negligible problem with a back cover or flip cover most likely to be used overall an excellent phone if within 12000 and of course with micromax there are not many doubts
4052	Micromax Canvas Turbo Mini A200 (Black)	its good working smooth gaming is good very light weight but battery backup is low primary camera is not so good

4095	Samsung Galaxy A7 SM-A700FD (Black)	worth buying better option than htc  desire 826with same specifications
4096	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	4 start for the product the phone has stunning locks and os is cool  but the phone which i received got dead on the 10th day and informed amazon  about the same then amazon told me that they require doadead on arrival certificate for which i went to blackberry expert center in nehru palace but those guys didnt  helped me as they can issue doa if  phone gets dead with 15 days from the date of purchase and not from the date of shipment those guys were not even willing to give that in written that my phone does not comes in doa processsuggested by amazon to get that in written   but i would like to thanks amazon that they helped me even though i was turned down by  blackberrypoor service from blackberry and refunded  my amount within three days amazon you rock
4097	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	this item was sold to me by lion deal vendor and it had few problems from the very first day like heating problem on charging network problem i  ignored these problems as it was same issue with by earlier smartphone but in just 45 months of time it started showing true colors very frequent network drops battery draining out in 30 mins of full charge when turned off turning it on again was a pain as it used to show no battery even through 3040 of battery was still left finally had to take it to service center on seeing the invoice from amazon he was bit reluctant to take it as it might not be a india product and hence the warranty but on insisting he took the handset and kept under analysis for 10 days post that he informed that the battery needs to be changed as its damaged and he reinstalled the os which might resolve other reported problems but he denied to change the battery as to my greatest surprise  the handset was not under india warranty i feel cheated by amazon  the vendor for proving unlocked handset and defective one
4098	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	omg the phone was available here at amazonin at 17899 with further cashback with my citibank credit card the phone is definitely worth the money the white looks stunning and the black is equally good i went for the white one though i have graduated from a sgs3 android and was using it with all the possible permutations with a custom rom and had even used it with the stock rom for around 7 months this phone does not feel sluggish the phone is having good speed for my basic tasks the phone is very good and the best part about it is the hub i have never got anything so universal it integrates everything however i would have liked it to include adding a news account to make it almost bbs blinkfeed but nonetheless it is super the gestures in the phone make me try to operate my old s3 in that manner too it is very captivating i miss it across all my other devices this one is a gamechanger for me one thing that not many people know the z10 or as a matter of fact any other bb10 device is capable of sideloading any android app however with the os update the bb10 is now capable of loading any android app in the ecosystem making you not miss any of the apps you loved on your android this is a great feature for me and i dont miss out on any of the apps the active frames of open apps are good i would recommend purchase of bebuzz pro on the z10 as it changes the phone completely now the things on my s3 that i miss here notification bar i used to use the old notification bar on my s3 too much just so much that every now and then when i would be within the app i may even quick reply there and not leave the app here the same is available but with a bit of a change with peeking in to the hub and replying and then returning however i liked the android notification bar more as it was customisable as well as gave more information moreover the nb was capable of being pulled from within an app also from android but z10 can only pull it down from home screen as within an app pulling down brings down options for that app however bb has promised to provide this by way of a two finger swipe down in the future os update the torch with the recent os update the torch was brought in the notification bar but due to its limited availability the same has been very less useful to me the phone app samsungs phone app was bogus and bb is only slightly better with automatically losing images in the speed dial and occasional bugs that make the search function within contacts nonoperational till a reboot i have ended up calling the first contact in my phone book at least ten times by mistake then i got to understand that with some symptoms showing up it needs a reboot overall satisfied with the phone and giving it a generous 5 stars only due to one thing value for money 10 out of 5
4099	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	otherwise  this is good except for battery charge  we have to charge the battery very often  and  it is  not  good
4100	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	i read reviews and discussions and watched youtube videos about bb z10 the model sold in india lacks snapdragon s4 processor and adreno 225 gpu so after price slash i thought its a reasonable purchase at  1718k after using the phone for some time i think the phone is worth to have pros nice sleek design colourful screen good earphone sound strong adhesion to cellular network notification led would be better if multi coloured new intuitive software bedtime mode great notification center at bbm hub compass app is excellent cons no map for kolkata india no call block option software sometimes feel complicated battery is on lower side stop nfc bluetooth wifi when not required disable wake up option by sliding from bottom of screen this will improve battery life and phone will easily last for a day or two ringing volume is very low camera performance is not good very few apps overall the phone might have bright future ahead if app market develops and some software flaws are rectified
4101	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	a true business phone indeed i love the hub typing and the browsing this is my third z10 bought 2 from other online store first for myself and my friend and bought 1 from here for my cousin  the battery gets you about 1416 hours on moderate use on a heavy use its about 10 hours the bb10 is a true gem fantastic to use waiting for 1031 update  only down side is that it is not for the apple or android fans  overall a great phone
4102	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	wrst phon n wrst service by amazonfed up by caling them again n again no satisfied ansplz care fr customer
4103	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	i bought this bb z10 amazing phone for the price it matches i phone 4 in performance 2gb ram is good enough for all apps 64 gb slot is as good as good can get display fantastic phone battery lasts 4 hours with continuous usage buy another extra battery for 500 the only problem is battery but the overall experience is great
4104	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	phone is stopped working after 60 days  returned to bb for replacement waiting for it now for 3 weeks
4105	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	z10 is an incredible blackberry handset if the battery backup is not taken into account i feel quite comfortable and easy to use the set at times the handset is getting overheated while using internet especially and only selected apps can be installed on the other side the handset looks awesome and user friendly too enjoy guys
4106	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	this phone is amazing lot of apps is available apps are all supply in android is also supports in this device it supports all video and audio formats many software update avaliable i like this very much camera quality is amazing front camera is equal to 5 mprich class experience 
4107	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	the blackberry z10 is so much better then my previous mobile its got all the features its much faster and it doesnt hang  only two issues though all the android apps dont work and the battery life is a tad less  other than that i love the phone so far keeping my fingers crossed
4108	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	i hate this phone and ur company  you supply worst product to customer this phon had many problemlow battery life hanging problem although it had 2 gb ram is that really possible battery get discharge in 2 hour belive mei will never purchase product from this site
4109	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	i am in love with this device its very intuitive and its crazy to say this but i find my blackberry z10 very mature thanks amazon for an awesome device with you i am not worried that i might have a bad online shopping experience
4110	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	some users report that the display is not that good low in brightness blackberry has inbuilt algorithm to automatically adjust with the surrounding light if you want to see full brightness then increase it to max under direct sunlight
4111	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	a good and handsome handset i would say but thats all it is not carrying many useful features of my earlier android phone for example call recorder cant explain how much i miss this app of my micromax canvas hd then screen off facility it is not available in any of the bb10 apps and the one downloaded from play store does not function properly in my z10 but list of negatives are limited z10 is actually a robust handset with extraordinary 2 gb ram which never feels tired in its performance the 16 gb internal memory is more than enough i have added 32 gb external card which is not at all utilized the hub is a perfect place for finding anything and everything you need battery life is satisfactory at least for me last but not the least i ma really impressed with the service of amazon initially i was a loyal customer of flipkart but gradually shifting loyalty only because of the prompt service of you
4112	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	pathetic hardware but excellent software these blackberry guys are genius when it comes to software operating system designing os 102 is simply the best but the hardware spec are too poorly designedassembledsome problem with hardware handset that i noticed  1  handset gets heated up without any reason and drains down the battery within couple of minutes forget about hours 2  within a month of purchasing the speaker of handset stopped working when i sent to the service centre for repair they did replace the handset but took 40 days to do that 3  now since last few days i am having handset booting up issues   good that blackberry has stopped production of z10 i hope they recall all sold z10 and replace it with new upgraded version
4113	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	firstly i would like appreciate amazon for the fast delivery  and about the product  in one word it is simply superb  i bought bbz10 about a month back to till date there is not even a single issue which is there in the review of others trust me  provided products differ from one to another got it is with 15 year manufacturer warranty and 6 months accessories warranty but not provided with any letters as such as we get while purchasing in any of the shops  internet multapps usage social media streaming everything is fine till date in fact better than any mobile of this price  mainly battery  it stands well for the moderate usage may not be satisfied if one watches or play games all the day over all this phone is kinda cool
4114	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	hello i liked the os simplicity and made of the manufacture i dint liked is the user friendly os there are no free apps like dat in android it is difficult to connect to other devices looks too old not much customization options not worth for the price the headset is like shiitt u get better when u buy samsung grand or moto g thank you
4115	BlackBerry Z10 (White)	great camera quality great looks nice screen sound quality good battery is average overall a must buy phone under 16k
4116	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	i read a lot of reviews on this phone and also considered the htc one m8 i decided to go for this one as it seemed to be the clear winner in every department however the phone is not perfect there are a couple of issues with the device that may be nothing to some but really cumbersome for others  pros 1 excellent display the display on this phone is a 2k display which is better than the 1080p displays which come on most phones the clarity is just amazing 2 great camera the camera on this phone is 13 megapixel its amazing for daylight photography and video recording 4k but its not the best at low light photography also i found the camera to be a bit slow compared to others this is easily fixable with a third party application like google camera 3 build quality though not the most premium feels really good in the hand the phone is really light and does not feel like the 5534 phablet that it is 4 rearfiring 1w speaker the speaker on the lg g3 is really good though it is rear firing although i prefer speakers that face you like on the one m8 this pleasantly surprised me as the sound quality is really good  cons 1 laggy interface the lg skin on top of android 50 yes the update is out is pretty heavy at least in my opinion and creates a laggy environment this can be reduced with some tweaks reducing animations and so on but this is slightly cumbersome for me 2 display is a bit dimmer than id have preferred in direct sunlight the autobrightness doesnt do a good job but i mostly control the brightness manually anyway 3 audio issue with 35mm jack this is the main issue i have with my lg g3 when i connect my headphones to the jack i can hear a background noise when i use the touchscreen on my phone this is really annoying however this is not the case when using bluetooth speakersheadphones this is not limited to my unit and there are lots of posts about it on xda 4 slightly creaky back the plastic back on my lg g3 creaks a little bit near the camera port this issue goes away when i put on the quickcircle case but is persistent on the normal back plate lg provides  overall i would give this phone 45 one star is knocked off because of the audio issue but like i said if you use bluetooth headphones and speakers this will not bother you in the slightest i would recommend this phone even with this issue as there are a whole lot of features to play around with and the specs are top of the line  if you liked my review please press the yes button below it helps me out a lot thanks 
4117	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	i did not go wrong with this mobile got it a few days back now im not a high end phone collector to splurge cash but this one time i needed to make the right move cause im going to be using this product for many years to come and this product just makes me feel everyday that i will do so  im not going to go over the specs of this phone as it is available everywhere on the internet im going to tell you the usage experience which i did not find much over the internet  the phone is fast no issues in that the stock lg firmware is very very good i mean generally everything stock is considered bloatware but people never give the time to use it lg has given some neat apps youll be using in your daily lives the home launcher is particularly good just enough customizations but not too overwhelming perfectly balanced im a heavy android user and have been using it extensively for 5 years  the quick circle case is very useful trust me pretty much everything basic to a phone like calling answering calls camera compass clock and weather calculator checking missed calls health apps etc can be used without even opening your cover yes and i absolutely love this feature it saves me a lot of time and battery the most useful feature i have used in this phone  the display is brilliant period dont worry too much about the negative reviews on the display in your daily usage you wont even notice it or get to know the negative points of the display youll grow to love the display every single day  as far as heating is concerned the phone gets moderately heated on heavy usage lg throttles a lot of stuff to bring down the temperature one of which is the display brightness ive found this to be useful and annoying too in some casesthere are ways to override this but i wouldnt suggest it rest assured it wont go into this mode in your average daily usage  the pics that it takes is on par with what i manage on my dslr i have no complaints regarding the camera or video quality  call quality is excellent on both caller and receiver side i have found no issues again data is fast by fast i mean detection is fast and makes usage of complete bandwidth which my old motorola atrix 4g could not achieve the battery drain is manageable data drains battery and so is the case in any phone  coming to the battery itself im a very heavy user of phone and this phone gives me about a day on my usage i browse a lot message a lot so naturally 3g data will always be on as long as i am out of my home which takes most of the day i watch videos and listen to music and fm while on the go so im very happy with the battery performance i have been able to push even 2 days on light to normal use just make sure to charge the battery to 100 and drain it completely to 0 first 5 to 10 times after you get your phone it also comes in with built in battery saver mode which is quite nifty it takes about 3 hrs to go from 0 to 100 charge and about half an hour to get charged to 40 so that is handy if time is of urgency  i loved the build of this phone most of all and it feels good to have spent 37k on this phone the design is beautiful and the phone itself looks elegant it fits in the hand just perfectly and in your pockets too its very light compared to competition it has a beautiful 55in qhd display which looks fantastic the colors are muted very pastel like and pleasing on the eye the bezels are almost invisible which adds to the beauty of the phone it does not have any hardware contextual buttons but ive not found them wanting in any case till now i can just about get anywhere in my phone in few touches  it has sd card support which makes it all the more sweet it has ir blaster and yes i never thought it would be this useful i use it to control my set top box it does support all the major set top box manufacturers and it works flawlessly im in love with this phone and it continues to surprise me everyday  it also comes with the dual window functionality which is handy and useful i constantly find myself using it be it browsing and messaging mail and browser note taking app and browser etc and it doesnt slow down even one bit it keeps up with my pace out of the box it supports only a few controlled applications in dual window mode which is quite limiting but i have rooted the phone and a simple switch from false to true i can now get any app in dual window mode but for users who are not into that sort of thing you might find this feature limiting hopefully theyll fix this in coming lollipop update  it also sports a floating window mode again to only set number of applications but ive never found that feature comfortable since it was introduced in android  coming to the stock keyboard i love it the first thing i do after receiving a new phone or os is to download either touchpal swiftkey or ai type keyboard which ive been using for years now only because the stock keyboards suck and hamper your productivity but lg has nailed it this time the keyboard that comes with g3 is hands down the best and the simplest ive seen till date it is neat clean fast and very very useful in the shortcuts and gestures it uses to give you the complete typing experience as i said lg has balanced this perfectly  as far as another selling feature knock code is considered its fun i say its fun cause its fun to open the screen that way but if anybody sees the way you knock trust me its very easy to read the knock pattern anybody can open the phone so dont expect your phone to be very secure but then again you have plethora of options along with knock like pattern lock password lock pin lock and face lock so use any of those to make your phone more secure the device wakes up if you knock it twice i find this very useful than having to find a button to wake it up every time  it also supports a lot of gesture based commands like flipping to mute a call the screen doesnt turn off when youre looking at the phone etc etc which im using everyday it is not intrusive and makes my phone experience very very smooth seamless and enjoyable experience  another talking point about this phone is the guest account setup with a different knock pattern you can set up a guest account for kids friends who you dont want to be viewing unnecessary content or change your settings you dont have to use an app or do any sort of time consuming black magic just knock it into guest mode pretty useful huh  final verdict  if you are looking in this range and are looking at galaxy s5 note 3 note 4 xperia z3 and lg g3 for the money id say buy this if the spen that comes with the note is not a limitation you could still buy a quality stylus and use it to take notes lg is taking all necessary steps to ensure that it becomes the best in this class and they are looking like committed to it thats a plus point considering g3 is the first to get a lollipop update barring nexus6 lg is committed whole heartedly in making its flagship the best and they have proved it with g3 you will love this device for years to come just go for it  ps  im not a lg fanboy and in fact this is my first lg phone i personally love motorola the most and to some extent htc i was skeptical about this phone before investing so much money but lg has blown me out of the water amazing product
4118	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	this phone is amazing in so many ways but that doesnt mean its perfect  the good  the screen is brilliant the text is the clearest ever and the screen is also bright with rich colours  the size of the screen means that you can get a lot of text on one page as well i love browsing the web on this thing and use it more often than my ipad even when im at home  superfast charging it goes from 10 to 90 in just over an hour  the phone is powerful too  its not the fastest phone on the market but after around a month of using this im yet to experience any lag or have any apps run slowly or have any issues  lots of smart features im not big fan of oems customising android but lg has been largely restrained and the changes that it has made are mostly positive for example the knocktounlock feature sounds a little pointless but given that the power button is on the back of the phone its useful the keyboard layout can be customised so you can add punctuation that you use the most often or change the position of some of the punctuation keys you can also holdswipe on the space bar to move the cursor and that is super helpful when entering urls for example  the quickcircle case that comes with the phone is also more useful than it initially appears youll be able to see whos calling and even respond to calls without having to open the cover but thats not all tap the empty space to see an analog watch and swiping that reveals call logs  so you can make a call without opening the cover messages to read any unread sms or activate the camera and take a picture right from the small circle its an excellent way of using the space and i just wish they could replace the watch face with google now cards in some future update  lg has also announced that the lg g3 will be getting android 50 next week starting with poland even if indian users dont get the upgrade at the same time i got the last software update on the same day that it was rolled out in the uk so im fairly confident that we wont have to wait too long  the bad  this phone is a little uncomfortable to use onehanded this sounds like a pretty obvious thing to say considering how big it is but the size of a phone isnt just about the screen size ive used the galaxy note 4 which my mother owns and thats actually a little more comfortable to use when youre sitting at home and reading or playing games thats not an issue obviously but when youre on the move and want to make a call or youre in office and want to quickly reply to a text this can get to be a problem there is an option to enable one handed use where the keys move to one side of the screen and you can rearrange the icons in the dock to have the back button be on the side of the screen you hold the phone from but these are not really enough to make it comfortable  it heats up a little quickly  not just when youre playing games where just about all phones ive used heat up but even if youre doing something simple like tweeting or texting people keep it up for too long and the phone gets warm not uncomfortable but warm and thats a little worrying  the power button and volume buttons are really awkward to use you wont have to for the most part software workarounds mean that ive had to press these buttons around once a week but thats just covering up for the fact that these buttons are incredibly inconveniently placed  the ugly  the battery discharges too quickly the quickcharge feature means that it isnt actually a big issue  as long as you keep your charger in your bag but in general youre going to charge this phone at least once a day and possibly twice depending on your usage my work is such that i have to take a lot of phone calls and do a lot of talking on my phone i use lot of apps regularly as well and most of this involves using 3g  so im definitely a heavy user that means that i usually bring the battery down to zero by lunch i charge the phone again in office and by the time i get back at around 7 its at 80 again i get up and the phones usually around 40 and i top it up to 100 before leaving at nine with all my older phones i was charging just at night so needing to charge this much is definitely a minus point for me  my verdict despite the fact that the phone burns through battery im really delighted with it i bought it during the diwali flash sale and thanks to some gift cards i ended up paying just around rs 27000 for the phone so its beyond amazing value for money but even at its current price id probably recommend buying it because theres so much to like
4119	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	yessssssss thats what i said because of so many pros it has if u want a high end phone with a high end specs  this is the phone go for it   first of all i have to say many negitive reviews about this phone are wrong  people say it is laggy battery not good enough brightness is not good enough k  then  here is my experience  1 it is buttery smooth as much as u can imagine 2 no lag friends no lag at any demanding sitivation  3 brightness i can use it 12 afternoon  under bright son  so think will ther be problem to use it in other places   i have used it for 15 days  2k display and 538ppi is awesom watching movies videos brousing internet is totally awesome and different from 1080p phones  iam playing games like gt racing 2 dead trigger2  causal games and it runs really well  battery    ill get full day on average to heavy usage  i downloaded games of 13 gb through wifi for 3 hours  and my battery came down  from100 percen to  75 percent  ony 25  battery reduced  camera is super fast because of laser auto focus  see the features of g3 in utube  u vill get it in no other phonea finally  pros and cones pros  fast charging fast camera  538 ppi smalleat phone in 55 inch screen size  many features  dual window dual camera 2k display quick circal case customisible ui  cons   no cons   mesage for samsung  get lost from india u are no more needed
4120	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	the phone is exceptionally good except for the battery which use to need charging in half a day which i thought was not good at all so i called up the helpline in amzone and they asked me to contact the lg service centre the lg service centre readily changed the battery  now i am a very satisfied customer
4121	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	the best and most powerful android phone you can buy todaythe ram is super fast camera clarity is superb especially the front cam just say cheese and it clicks the best selfiestap unlock is a super way to unlock your device no need to press any keys  the display is end to end bezel less absolutely stunning and the audio loudspeaker sounds like a concert  i see no negative in the phone apart from the fact that lg is not considered a premium brand  i got the iphone 6 plus before this and absolutely hated the restrictions ios has gotso gave it within a week and got the g3 after reviewing online and its 3 months now  absolutely loving this phonego for it you will never regret it

4126	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	can say only fabolous pros compared to xperia z2   call quality gsm signal strength wifi reception camera clarity loudspeaker  build in speakers loudness number of extra options like one handed keyboard dial pad lock in box headphones are truly very awesome every single rupee on this purchase is buy back seriously after long 15days survey had opted for this mobile my initial idea was to buy iphone 6 only pricing and branding are plus nothing found impressive  if some options like quick memo volume keys placement guest mode t action quick remote never can be found in any other device  lets say when you mount the phone to the car holder volumes never disturb at any point quick memo to note anything like phone numbers address anything for emergency guest mode for kids bye to bye to apps lock remote is awesome no need to carry 23 remotes in hand works with every led dth box too  every single app are designed which are useful to our needs  now coming to z2 beside water  dust proof nothing much impressive as defects  cons on z2 which are 1 loudspeaker volume of voice while on call is pretty low which couldnt able to handle group discussions 2 signal strength reception is not all good if office is 3 floors and when am sitting in the 1st floor never ever used to get  finally used every network may be this is the problem but nothing to do with the networkz2 has this problem not only mine many of them has faced same 3 no such options like quick memo remote and other stuff as above 4 only best at camera body build quality which doesnt required at all the times to safeguard mobile  for every detailed much much more go through the link and z2 review i had shared after 8 months usage httpwwwgsmarenacomlgg3vssonyxperiaz2review1100php
4127	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	great phone awesome camera awesome accessories intuitive interface and features  with a 55 inch quad hd display with the thinnest bezels in the world you know that you are using a great phone  battery life is also good with 3000 ma battery which can easily last 12 14 hours according to the usage 
4128	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	got this product yesterday all i can say everything is good like camera scren quality  but the battery back up sucks it lasted for 25hr only and it get super hot when u play video over wifi just want say if u need good battery back dnt go for this
4129	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	would just like to say firstly that amazon very well executed this order n got it on my doorstep on the 2nd day of ordering rest the product is very nice battery life is fair enough for the exceptional screen experience we get vooume is loud as china mobileslolwell done lg
4130	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	i have been using the phone for about a month at first the phone seemed big but then got use to it the performance of the phone is great handles multitasking easily but it do lag a bit sometimes the user interface is nice  has good customizable featuresi liked the double tab to wakeup  lock and the customizable on screen buttons battery life is normal even with 3000mah capacity rear camera is fine with not much options under settings front camera seems better even with 21mp display is good text  images looks nice  crisp call quality is fine auto brightness features makes the screen dull back panel sometimes gets warm while multitasking mainly surfing on 3g network  overall phone is great
4131	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	the phones is good look wiseinfact i would say the best one but the only area it lags is the battery of the phoneafter lolipop also the standby time of the battery is too badi was unable to get half day also with the battery of lg g3 with full battery the moment u switch to lte or 3g network in use itur phone is surellly gonna die in 3 hrs or 3hrs 30min max so if u can comprise with the battery life or u are not that heavy user then this phone is the best  and i forgot to mention about the camers and the screen  this phones comes with the best camera u would have ever used in the smartphone till date and the is reallly awesome nd beautifull
4132	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	product was as described and working in perfect condition its been a few months since i purchased the device online but i havent faced any problems with it the delivery was prompt and the box sealed good buy
4133	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	there is so much of lagging on the arrival day itself not satisfied
4134	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	definitely the best phone out in the market today
4135	LG G3 D855 (Titan Titan, 32GB)	excellent phone with top end spec and features extended memory support and otg usb drive support are flawless and very useful the sound output is sufficient for moderate use the battery will hold through the day the power and volume rocker buttons at the back of the phone would take time to get used to but one does not have to use it those functions are available on screen with gps use the phone tends to get hot which i guess is normal as it used to happen with my iphone as well overall its a great phone and one of the best phones available in the market dec 2014
4136	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	another one in the ever increasing canvas fraternity just a souped up version of older versions  pros 1 main is the battery long lasting charge very good performance after surfing net playing game listening music watching videos etc etc 2 quad core processor  really fast for apps 3 secondary camera in this range goodnot great 4 534 screen also good  cons 1 512 mb ram really upset for this cant play real steel subway surfer temple run etc 2 very heavy weight you will not like it for sure 3 camera not good photo quality like 2 mp front camera very bad 4 internal memory is very minimum 5 android should be 44 kitkat  this device fails to make its mark in the ever evolving budget smartphone segment micromax needs to do better than this
4137	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	two aspects needs to be improved on a 96 1 the camera quality is pathetic its not 5 mp as told and sold the internal memory of 4 gb gets consumed very fast it has to be minimum 8 gb the ram 512 makes the phone very slow which needs an up gradation to 1 gb micro max may launch another version of a96 with these features and may keep the prices a few bucks more
4138	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	4000mah battery is a rarity in under rs10000 devices other 2 devices that packs such a huge one are xolo q3000 and lenovo p780 this can easily last 2 days of moderate to heavy use with wifi on  apart from the impressive batterysome other specs are disappointing it does have a good processorgpu combination that scores well in benchmarks tests and gives good performance  the display resolution is not that great480 x 854 pixels on a 5inches screen is not that good to look at one other area where it performs poorly is the camera  5mp fixed focus one without the auto focus capabilitiesexpect it to give you a lot of bad images  memory  this only has 512 mb of ramwhich can be an issue sometimes when multitasking out of 4gb internal storage 144g  is available for apps  114g is reserved for the user storage otg is supported and an otg cable is included in the box  overall a budget device aimed at heavy usersbut have some issues like i mentioned above if you dont mind charging your phone every day before going to sleepthen its better to get other under 10k quadcore 1gb ram devices with better camera and screen resolution than buying this  closest competitor  gioneem2 coming with 4200mah batterybetter camera and more rambut priced a little higher than this
4139	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	there is some false case with the device micromax power a 96 it claims that 13 ghz quad core processor  please check other device with similar pckages with 512 mb ram  in compaire to others processing is slow more than 120 than samsung sony nokia and 95 slower than its own micromax karbonn spice xolo phone running operating system in android422  it irritates with dynamic hanging system after 253 month sale and micromax service centers are full of suffring people as the problem for above said  service centre doing their job well by reinstalling the software  after one month the same problem comming back  its a basic problem with micromax where as karbonn has the basic problem of battery backup  the only good thing is 4000 mah battery gives heavy usage of almost 1314 hours everyday usage over highly surfing endurance  i have purchase the product at 7399 from amazon with 17 hours delevery time satisfaction through internet cash on delivery order  gamming is resticted in this device  facebook comments are annoying to wring speed is misarable slow  you could not expect multitasking in this device  i have no such expertise view about the video quality with this device in compare to its other 5 mp camera device of mmx  sound quality is good but not enough for outdoor receiver or caller  its very helpful only those who cant other activities than call receiving or calling  its not meet the expection of value for money at the price range of 6000
4140	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	it hangs again and again and sometimes is gets slower only battery is the plus point it is less attractive than karbonn titanium s2 plus mobile which is of the same price i am disappointed
4141	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	a little bit heavy due to its large capacity battery and 5inch size but overall it is a very nice android to use fast processor in this price tag and it also support otg on the go external pen drive which is not available in this price in any other android again i would like to say battery life is superb
4142	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	main problem is hanging while receving  or dailingpl  dont sell this mobile to public
4143	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	i had to sell out this phone only after a month its 512 mb ram makes this phone worse
4144	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	amazonin has offered me best deal for this device its basically mistake from micromax a manufacturing company this mobile is so simple  easy to use its os is good  battery backup is too good as campare to any other android phones but there is major problem abt the device speed the 512 mbps ram it is not properly done there is 5 inch screen mobile and just 512 mbps ram is just too low for that this mobile is good for rough  tough use internet 3g speed is also good but when you trying to play game on this mobile it is starts hanging continuously so it shows that this mobile is not made for playing a game
4145	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	i got it defective and so i dont like it very very bad and i returned and waiting for more than a week
4146	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	worst experience hangs a lot im a minimal user uses few reader apps and whatsapp hangs at least twice a day only good thing is batteryfourth time im giving it to service center two time they gave back in two daysonly to be hung in a fortnight third time it was sent to delhi for one month last time they offered a swap and took my phone one week now no contact not taking phone my simple advice is before squaring in for a phone visit your nearest service center and see the rush there
4147	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	vey low quality andslowest mobile in the history of mobilein one sentence i shall say dont buy itonly good thing is batteryotherwiseeven for calling u have to way for 30 sec sometime when u will press the buttonit will react after 5 sec most irritating even after that that if u want to purchase i am ready to sell my one  with half cost than amazon my no is 9085943656
4148	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	i have eight words to describe this phone 1useless 2bakwas 3hangs every now n then 4touch an icon n reaction aftr 10secs 5extra heavy 6onlly option is to take out bttry when it hangs 7bakwas storage 8anybody interested can take from me suggesting nt to buy
4149	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	please dont buy this product i purchased on 30th august 2014  after 4 month its a volume issue in the devise when i call to other guy or receive any call then the volume is break and very low i am very frasted now  request to amazon for return back or exchange the product as soon as possible not recommend to any one for buy the product
4150	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	i have got this item on april 8 2015 from may 2 2015 it stopped working it is to make people fool by providing 4000 mah battery since its ram is 512 mb it could not do multitasking and hang all time so dont go by high battery capacity what will the battery do if it does not work at all its the worst product i had ever purchased
4151	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	it get hang vry muchthe apps are not  running  nicelydue to which the phone get hang and i cant play games also becoz they run this phone
4152	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	it hangs a lot and is a bit heavy due to the large 4000 mah battery battery backup is superb but you cant only buy a smartphone bcoz of the battery after filling up half of the space it reacts slowly  you touch an icon and its gonna open after 23 seconds camera is average better go for another phone at this range
4153	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	i bought it for the battery which is no doubt very long lasting  nothing compared to any other phone i have seen had to charge only once in 45 days but the touch is very very poor and the overall response time for the phone is very slow and gets frustrating i also died completely and has become useless in 11 months
4154	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	the phone can be used only for making calls and sending sms if you want to use any other games or browse internet the phone will hang with default ui provided by micromax is not good and phone is slow you should install a lighter ui for phone to function normally battery is good i use this phone sparingly hence with single charge i can use for 5 days it can be used as a basic phone with longer battery life radio is very poor camera is ok
4155	Micromax Canvas Power A96 (Black)	hello all amazon customers i would like to share my personal view about micro canvas power a96 its good for long battery life but not good for person they have use lots of androids applications and playing games because major problem in this phone is hanging otherwise all  functions are good thanks

4166	Sony Xperia Z2 (White)	first day of use this is an ultimate phone display speed camera everything is world class no questions asked i dont know why was z3 launched this phone is 10k cheaper with 0 difference maybe even better just that z3 is sexier looking but youll be just as happy with z2 with everything it offers
4167	Sony Xperia Z2 (White)	hi    the delivery done was within a day and i should say phone is great but when it is being advertised that a health band and a case is in the box and i see it missing in the package i was let down  in this case the so called discount on amazon is false it should be clearly written that this offer is without freebiesdont make fool of customers  neeraj
4168	Sony Xperia Z2 (White)	when sony xperia z1 released i was one of the first customers to buy the handset from flipkart with lot of excitementbut trust me i am experiencing pathetic customer service from the customer care and service center department  sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products but in my case i failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like xperia z18230  1 on 24th december when i woke up in the morning i saw my xperia z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet there was no damage on the external glass but however the display had cracked from inside a single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked8230  2 in my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18000 rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on its own from inside there is no sign of external damage on the screen  3 sony customer care executives and sony service center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances they are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status i had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the sony service center i know few acquaintances who had similar experience with service center bhubaneswar  4 my handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me i requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked if i can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why cant the technicians employed by sony do the same  arent they qualified enough  5 while i handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when i received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly i have the photographs available with me  6 i had heard that sony xperia z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me  7 after sending an email to sony senior management in india sony head office support team sent an email stating i have to pay 50 of mrp for refurbished handset without accessories and 80 of mrp rs 28500 for fresh handset without accessories8230 prices offered by local sony service center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price8230 whatever happens to your handset sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k 30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment8230  it8217s really frustrating as sony customer service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty designbad quality equipment being used  trust me guys the service being offered by samsung for galaxy s4 which is a comparable model with z1 is much better than sony8230 sony is having the worst after sales service8230 i would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free82308230
4169	Sony Xperia Z2 (White)	well i bought this phone in december 2014 ya its been 6 months since i am using this phone i was lucky enough to get this phone at a price of 37500remember mentioned price was during novdec times through snapdeal website wherein the accessories includes smart band  case let me not waste much of your timeso here are my observations after using it for 6 months  pros 1 this phone looks simply brilliant glossy appearance gives an added advantagefor white color handsets 2 great display looks truely hd 3 there is no lag or hang as seen in typical samsung phonesapologies for samsung lovers buffering is also gud 4 video playback is extraordinary with clear sound through front facing speakers 5 battery back up is also gud moderate usage will result in atleast 40hrs of backup you will easily get through the day without any worriesas i mentioned it is for moderate use here is detailed analysis made on battery back up low usagecallsmessagessurfing for few mins to hours battery will easily last for two days moderate usagecallsmsgs surfing for couple of hours gaming for half an hour easily lasts for a day high usageextreme gaming regular calls and msgs surfing for couple of hours lasts for 6 to 7 hours 6 ofcourse this phone is water resistant you can boldly take it into pools on my experience till date 7 it comes with stamina and ultrastamina modes for power savers for extended battery backup 8 camera no words to explain it sony are the true masters in this if you really want to compare its camera then pls do it with slrs and not other phones  you get pleanty of features to use 9 though it is 160 gms it doesnt feel heavier 10 phone is sturdy enough screen doesnt breat out easily as seen in typical nexus phones  cons 1 too much touch sensitive sometimes if there is water drops or finger prints on the screenit automatically starts selecting some icons withour your knowledge if the phone is not locked 2 glossy look lead to fingerprint magnet for black and purple phones 3 earpiece given along with this phone is not satisfactory no noise cancellation headset provided 4 phone gets overheated while shooting a 4k video or playing game for more than half an hour of 20 mins  conclusion there is no doubt that this phone is simply a superb in all aspects except some few minor cons as specified i would definitely suggest you to go with this phone however if you are a game lover i suggest you to stay away from this phone as it burns your skin from overheating d hope this review will be usefull it is ultimately you who have to take the decision
4170	Sony Xperia Z2 (White)	i purchased this phone from techfone with an offer price of 30994 i used this phone for around 10 days all the features were excellent but most likely the handset that i received has some problems like 1 the phone gets heated even if you play a small games for few minutes 25 mins 2 while talking for small duration it gets heated up heavily
4171	Sony Xperia Z2 (White)	the best part in the phone is the camera its superb
4172	Sony Xperia Z2 (White)	still to find out always see exact model nobefore i wanted d6503 but i received d6502 what to do
4173	Sony Xperia Z2 (White)	this is the worst phone i have ever had screen cracks and its flap breaks off within just six months but somehow its not covered in warranty plus the after sales service is absolutely horrible as they are rude and overcharge you for basic things in the phone camera is far from how its advertised  my suggestion is simply dont buy this phone and save your money i will never buy another sony product
4174	Sony Xperia Z2 (White)	this is an awesome phone as expected camera quality is outstanding cannot match with anyone dont ever lag and no heating problem during using it  battery backup is also quiet good its stamina mode is very much impressive can keep your mobile alive for atleast 2 days worth buying this product thankyou sony you made my day

4191	Salora Njoy E4 (Black)	had bought this phone with not much of an expectation however the phone surprised me indeed the configuration of 2000mah battery with 4 gb internal storage around 24 gb available for users and a 512 ram most smartphones at this price range have 256 mb ram does really work out camera is average at best do not expect this camera to take grain free images in low light it does its job more or less in well lighted areas  the look and feel is awesome and the touch screen is more than you can expect from the budget this phone fits in the smart key options are very well thought out if you want your basic phone to be replaced by a smartphone but you are not very confident using an android phone go for it

4245	Spice Mi-520n (Black) with 3 Back Panels (Red, Yellow, White)	rom is not 8gb as described it only 4gb
4246	Spice Mi-520n (Black) with 3 Back Panels (Red, Yellow, White)	i bought for this phone for one simple reason for the price point 7000 it has better features than any other option in this range so far three days this phone has been excellent in just about every way and it delivers as the description promises the screen is very bright crisp and responsive with no lag note i do not play games so i dont know how good it is for those i have yet to have any malfunctions crashes or unexpected behaviors while transferring apps files and so forth from my old phone till date i am very happy with it a few points  android version is indeed 442 kit kat like most phones it partitions its internal storage 3gb is available for apps 3gb for phone storage i assume the rest is being used by the android os apps that allow for it may be transferred to an sd card without difficulty so theres plenty of storage room available the cameras are quite good both indoors and out most problems people have with phone cameras come from either not holding it steady or insufficient light on the subject also if youre really interested in taking good photos consider getting a decent digital camera theres only so much you can do with a phone the looks of the phone are also quite good the back covers are very glossy and thus pick up a lot of fingerprints but overall the phone doesnt look cheap and the build seems to be sturdy enough  the flip cover does not turn the screen onoff when you openclose it theres no notification light   the phone comes preloaded with more junk apps that i like but not as nearly bad as my old htc but surprisingly at least some of them can be uninstalled  battery life is about average neither especially good nor especially bad i have not noticed any heating at all while using or charging but again i dont play games with heavy graphics  so far im very happy with this phone for the price it is excellent and i hope that it quickly becomes one of the more popular budget smartphones in india
4247	Spice Mi-520n (Black) with 3 Back Panels (Red, Yellow, White)	spice brand is finally getting out of the lowonpricelowonfeatures rut one of the surprising things about spice mobiles in 2014 is how serious have they been in shedding their cheap phone  so some too features perception after the successful spice 498 android one device the 520n seems to be another spice smartphone which has all the desired featues  i like the 1 gb ram feature the best  any phone with less than 1 gb ram is kaput i say i also like that all of this is available under rs 7000 good going spice  in summary the 520n is best in class and worth your money
4248	Spice Mi-520n (Black) with 3 Back Panels (Red, Yellow, White)	its good phone from spice with very good featuresbut i will still recommended you to buy huawei honor holly because almost all features are same and still there are more features in honor here is comparison between huawei and spice   notification light  16 gb13 gb usable inbuilt memory  in huawei but only 8 gbonly 3 gb usable in spice  other all features and price are same  so i will recommend you to buy 34 huawei honor holly 34 as i am using it since 31 days  from  prem shah pspsps357gmailcom

4269	Nokia XL (White, Dual SIM)	not upto the standards which nokia is known for i ordered this phone from amazon delivery was not very prompt it took almost 34 days though the phone was delivered from a location in bangalore itself i ignored the delayed delivery as i was looking forward to a nokia experience till date i have been using nokia phones only my previous phone was a nokia lumia  i have been using the phone for the past 2 days i have been facing a lot of issues  a phone hangs i would have rebooted the phone at least 810 times in the last 2 days b response from the touch screen is really really not up to the mark sometimes i have to tap 5  6 times for one function c there seems to be a problem in the audio hardware part of the phone i called my family on a landline i was able to hear them but they were not able to hear my voice this happened 4  5 times today after sometime every thing became normal when i called again and we were able to talk
4270	Nokia XL (White, Dual SIM)	nokia xl is the best budget phone with features such as a front camera  rear camera and some inbuilt apps such as here maps zombies vs plants  many more apps it has a very big 534 screen but somethings are there that we shouldnt buy this mobile because it doesnt have playstore  the ram is very less you would use some third party app stores like yandex aptoide 1mobile store  many more apps from my opinion its a good buy
4271	Nokia XL (White, Dual SIM)	ive been using this phone for over an year now and the reason that this phones price has gone down tremendously in just one year is its poorly developed uiuser interface and osoperating systemnokia  says that this phone supports android os but it dosent supports a number of android appsthe app store dosent downloads the full app and in addittion to that the store has very less no of good quality appsthe outdated nokia ui is approximately the poorest in the price segmentin addition to all thisit also doesnt supports a number of high end games and apps which one can download from one mobile marketsome other bugs are as follows °poor battery qualityyou need to charge it twice a day or thrice if you ise wifi °fastlane is of no use °large number of android applications arent supportedto call it aandroid is a fraud by nokiathat makes this phones os neither windows nor android °storage problemi installed a 16gb memory card in this phone but still i got space around 2gb in addition to all thisthe phone has some features which are best in its segment °best cameraboth rear and front °large display °when a high end is installed  somehowbecause it usually dosent supports number of appsgames like even airborne and nova the only 2 high end games which ran in this phonefunction butter smooth °it never lags in any app °beutiful design

4289	Micromax Smarty 4.3 A65 (Black)	hi  i received the micromax smarty 43 a65 on 10th may 2014 for 46k from amazon the package was awesome and thanks to amzon  however the product was not satisfactory since mobile speaker is not good during the call even though we keep incoming call volume to maximum the voice was coming with low volume so its difficult to listen properly if we want louder then need to turn on speaker mode but its not possible always to turn on  similarly the camera is very bad during daylight as well and this mobile comes with flash but not sure why micromax has given thisits not at all useful to take photos  similarly i found screen touch is also not good enough needs to be improved by micromax  its having android upgrade problem as well ie it comes with gingerbread android version and cant upgrade to ics or jelly bean and also we cant upgrade our network band to 3g since its not supported maximum 2g is supported  so finally i returned the product to amzon since it was not fulfilling my requirements

4298	Samsung Galaxy A5 (White)	got this phone after my s3 broke and repair price was high my requirments were for 2gb ram 4g support 5inch exact screen and avoid mediatek   pros 1 charging takes 1hr  for almost full charge with bundled charger this is very good plus point it lasts for 810 hours on high usage battery drain is same as any other phone i have used including samsunghuewailgnokiasony quick charging is something i really like drain differs on wifi3g  2 supports 4g in bangalore i am getting 2 bars when on 4g guess network has to expand on 3g i get full network strength  3 2gb ram does its job phone is pretty reponsive  4 in comparison to my s3 this has lower cpu speeds but this had 64bit cpu and with 2gb ram phone is good to handle  5 ui is good im not big fan of samsung ui but i still prefer it over lgxiomihuewai interface provides me with good number of shortcuts stuff u dont want can be disabled and hidden  from your view a5 will get andriod 5 update or u can do that manually i prefer to wait  5 phone design is quite good has premium look its  light weight i went with spigen ultra clear case for a5 as i did not want to hide the body under flip covers  cons 1 screen resolution is not that good i knew that before buying but at 20k 350 ppi is expected s3 4years back had same screen resolution phone price should be around 1617k just for this reason  2 included inear headphone sucks 3rd grade quality i overcame crapy sound quality by  installing sound equilizer app and then listened on my sennheiserhd202 headphones sound later was much much better speaker is not that great for music  3 while listening  to calls on both caller and reciver end there is that hisss added to sound its clear alright but this additional ssssss is irritating after two days i forgot about it as sound by itself is clear  4 front camera gives all glossy pictures did not like  5 back camera is good but as soon as light reduces the camera struggles i still prefer s3 camera u have to be steady with shutter else very easy to get blur photos  all things i m not talking about are pro since features are seamless this is very responsive solid phone for a higher price i would had gone for e7 but that does not support 4g on high usage phone does not heat up like s3s4 and s5 heating issue prevented me from going for s4 and s5 check reviews online    
4299	Samsung Galaxy A5 (White)	im working good with this  a5 the best shape and size  camera as well as front is pretty good 
4300	Samsung Galaxy A5 (White)	its an amazing product at this price
4301	Samsung Galaxy A5 (White)	samsung galaxy a5 announced at ces 2015 is a mid range phone with decent specs overall  build quality and looks  following the footsteps of galaxy alpha a5 has a slimunibody design with metal all over which gives this phone great looks overall a5 is the first samsung smartphone with a full metal body i wonder what took them this long to come up with metallic build ones like galaxy alpha and galaxy a5  software  galaxy a5 is powered by a 12ghz qualcomm msm8916 snapdragon 410 cortex a53 quad core processor and adreno 306 gpu it is running android kitkat 44 out of the box with touchwiz ui on top as usual it has 2 gb ram to help in good multitasking and gaming experience one new thing in the touchwiz on a5 is it now supports themes  only icons can be changed and there are only a few available now  samsung is also bringing in adaptable audio which will automatically increase or decrease the volume in response to the background noise around you  display  it has a 5 inch 720p hd super amoled display which is as always good to look at it offers good outdoor visibility and viewing angles  camera  this has a 13mp sony exmor imx135 sensor  1306inch this same sensor is seen in older devices like samsung galaxy s4 lg g2 moto x etc overall performance of this sensor is fine and takes good pictures in good light but suffers in low light conditions it has a 5mp front camera for selfies and video callsfor selfie lovers it has a 110° view and you can snap a selfie with your voice or palm  battery  sammobile is reporting the 2300mah battery on board the a5 performs really well and gives great battery backupultra power saving mode reduces battery consumption by shutting down unnecessary functions ensuring longer battery life from a single charge  overall samsung has put out a good midrange metallic android smartphone it would have been great if it had a better camera sensor atleast the one on the galaxy s5 a5 has got a good displayand good battery backup making it a good buy for samsung touchwiz lovers looking at this phone critically though if you are an s5 or even an s4 user you should better stick with that rather getting on to this one unless you are buying this for the metallic looks and a slightly better software experience  note samsung india website says a5 is a dual sim phone while the amazon listing here says single nano sim i am not sure if amazon is selling a single sim variant sammobile notes on dual sim a5 phones  34you can either insert two sim cards or use one sim card and a microsd card as one of the slots is common for both a sim card and a microsd card34
4302	Samsung Galaxy A5 (White)	there should also de insorence
4303	Samsung Galaxy A5 (White)	with the a series we can conclude that samsung is trying to sort out the design problems it has had for years with the galaxy alpha the metal body was introduced in samsung phones but the back was still made of plastic but a series features full unibody design which gives the phone a sturdy feelsturdy yet not premium the ram is plenty for a phone but what seems to be a point of concern here is the processor which is comparable to the processors of a few android wearquadcore 12 ghz cortexa53 what that means is that while the phone feels snappy in daily tasks its exhibits a lacklustre performance in resource hogging tasks like gaming a great new feature is that the micro sd card slot doubles as a sim card slot to make the phone dual sim but that features compromises expandable memoryso to sum it up   pros 1 sturdy build 2 2gb ram 3 interchangeable micro sdup to 64gbdual sim card slot 4 nice camera13 mp rear and 5 mp front with features like wide frame selfies and animated gif selfies 5 super slim67mm 6 corning gorilla glass 4 7 battery lasts a day no issue though it is a 2300liion mah battery this is because both the screen and the processor are not as powerful so they could do well with less juice  cons 1 mediocre screen720p screen in year 2015 though its 294 ppi and its still difficult to spot pixels from a practical distance in 720p screen still higher resolution produces more vivid and sharp images though it is more taxing on the battery which becomes somewhat significant here as the battery is less powerful 2 less powerful processorquadcore 12 ghz cortexa53 3 sound is not good samsung should have put the speakers on the side rather than on the back 4 otg not supported 5 android 444 out of the boxan update may be on its way 6 metal back is prone to scratches 7 high price for the specifications  bottomline this phone has almost the same specifications as lenovo a6000 but is more costly the sturdy build and slim form factor makes the phone feel good in hand but still lacks a premium touch the camera is good and the comparable brother is galaxy s5 except for the fact that this phone is 12 ghz quad while s5 has 25 ghz quad core processor so while this phone is launched recently still it would be a better choice to stretch the budget a little bit and buy the s5 as this phone brings nothing exceptionally appealing to the table except for a sturdy design and a undue price

4360	Sony Xperia Z3 (Black)	when sony xperia z1 released i was one of the first customers to buy the handset from flipkart with lot of excitementbut trust me i am experiencing pathetic customer service from the customer care and service center department  sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products but in my case i failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like xperia z18230  1 on 24th december when i woke up in the morning i saw my xperia z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet there was no damage on the external glass but however the display had cracked from inside a single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked8230  2 in my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18000 rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on its own from inside there is no sign of external damage on the screen  3 sony customer care executives and sony service center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances they are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status i had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the sony service center i know few acquaintances who had similar experience with service center bhubaneswar  4 my handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who expired this year and that was more valuable to me i requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked if i can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why cant the technicians employed by sony do the same  arent they qualified enough  5 while i handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when i received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly i have the photographs available with me  6 i had heard that sony xperia z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me  7 after sending an email to sony senior management in india sony head office support team sent an email stating i have to pay 50 of mrp for refurbished handset without accessories and 80 of mrp rs 28500 for fresh handset without accessories8230 prices offered by local sony service center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price8230 whatever happens to your handset sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k 30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment8230  it8217s really frustrating as sony customer service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty designbad quality equipment being used  trust me guys the service being offered by samsung for galaxy s4 which is a comparable model with z1 is much better than sony8230 sony is having the worst after sales service8230 i would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free82308230

4417	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, White)	i bought this phone for my mom it is her first smartphone and she did not even know how to operate a touchscreen phone earlier the best thing about windows phone is that even a new owner can get used to it in no time my son though just 7 is quite well versed with smartphones and loves to play games he has installed several racing games and one or two games that require highend graphics what i was pleasantly surprised was how this phone plays all those games there is no lag whatsoever the screen in itself if quite decent and way better than xaomi or micromax phones the camera is another big plus though it is just 5mp it takes better pictures than motog 2nd gen 1 mp secondary camera is also bright and clear enough for video calls and you would not notice any graining and drop in quality during video calls the battery life is good though my mom is not a heavy user at all but with her mild and my sons gaming usage it lasts about 15  2 days comfortably last but not the least build quality is amazing for an entry level phone the plastic is pretty decent and it does not feel cheap overall a simple basic design but an effective one
4418	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, White)	nokia 532 comes equipped with a qualcomm snapdargon 200 12ghz quad core msm8212 proccessor with an adreno 302 gpu this is just okay for the price of 6k7k yes its definitely a good initiative from microsoft to provide an alternative lumia for the budget seekers but i think this phone is dated plus why should someone go for lumia 532 when you can get lumia 630 with a snapdragon 400 cpu and a clear black 45 inch ips screen for 6kyeah its true that lumia 532 comes with 1gb ram but it simply doesnt have the cpu nor the gpu to fully capitalize on since this is a windows phone the 512 mb of ram would be more than enough for all day to day usage and only while gaming on high graphics the defieciency of ram maybe felteven you can go lumia 638 with all the internals of lumia 630 plus the 1gb of ram is available at 7k ie the same price of 532 since not only the performance even the screen quality of 638 is much better than this people looking for a good phone at this price irrespective of the os ie windows or android go for android one for 55k or you can even wait for the redmi 2 thats expected to come in a few months for 6k microsoft introduces this phone at a time when budget users are spoilt for choices with so many alternatives at their disposal had they done it a year before then it might have attracted buyers but not now plus their pricing policy is also strange they are even competing with themselves by making lumia 630638 sell for a similar price only pro of this phone is that it is a dual sim variant while the 638 is not but you can get a dual sim variant of 630 and only for this feature i am providing 3 star otherwise it would have been two if you liked my review kindly press the like button below and support me to write more reviews like this in future

4431	Sony Xperia E1 (Dual SIM, Black)	good mobile for sony lovers with a good interface and under budget tooi am using this mobile for almost 50days no problem working fine i bought this mobile because its of its unique walkman feature which is am impressed bass is good and music is supper clear otherwise in other mobiles if we increase the bass you wont get good music effects but this mobiles bass and music is good dint expect much from this mobile couz of 512mb of ram but high ends games are working good which i am impressed and daily use battery backup and performance is good too
4432	Sony Xperia E1 (Dual SIM, Black)	handset casing seems to be a cheap quality plastic earlier i was using nokia c200 i felt that overall build quality and finish are better in nokia there is some difference in performance of  2 sim slots same sim is giving poor signal strength in the first slot and good signal strength in the second slot from same location  the item supply was quick but not willing to provide any support after the sale  i suggest to consider moto  ge before making a final decision
4433	Sony Xperia E1 (Dual SIM, Black)	xperia e1 satisfies my requirement walkman app is awesome able to play 3d games without lag tested temple run2 it is fast but disappointed with camera pictures are very noisy i will recommend this for music lovers and basic 3d game players
4434	Sony Xperia E1 (Dual SIM, Black)	delay in delivery due to typo in pin code no and also some hassle due to nonavailability of clear information on detailed status of delivery  parcel tracking otherwise packing was good and  all content were ok as ordered
4435	Sony Xperia E1 (Dual SIM, Black)	build is very poor quality for this proce range we can get better phones in other brands back panel is of very cheap plastic quality

4444	Sony Xperia E1 (Dual SIM, Black)	i had purchased it 2 months ago it would reboot itself and then it stopped working when it got barely wet in rain the service center when contacted told that the product was now out of warranty because of the water and i would have to pay rs 4000 for the repair of the phone that cost me rs 8200
4445	Sony Xperia E1 (Dual SIM, Black)	rates and delivery is great
4446	Sony Xperia E1 (Dual SIM, Black)	i am planning to get it from flipkart since they offer a low price plus headphone free better to go for it

4449	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	the best deal for this budget you wont frankly regret after xolo xperience  goods 1 awesome looking phonesuper sexy 2 great speed and fluid touchcomes close to i phone in touch 3 video claritysimply mesmerizing 4 the octa core lets you run multiple apps at a time without slowing down 5 get a 3g recharge and theres no stopping u 6 the 55 version does not have xolo logo up in the frontso that makes it way better looking  bads  1 front camera is badwhen i say bad 2 sound via loudspeakers not up to the mark 3 bit large for smaller hands 4 camera clarity is not good in low light but it is acceptably good
4450	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	this is well a very awesome smartphone battery backup is awesome  all works good loud speakers  14ghz octacore awesome speed hive themes are amazing
4451	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	this is a superb smartphone which stands out from any expensive crap samsung or moto or htc has to offer i feel proud again to say that its an indian phone which wont let you down the only con i can find is that i am unable to find a back case or a flip case for ithoping to get it soon from amazon itself amazing camera hive ui rockss octa core at workphone didnt hang even after i was multitasking with morre than 5 apps at the same time battery backup superrr i am in love with xolo 101 out of 100 from me
4452	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	pros 1 camera during day time is awesome during night time its good 2no lag even while using 56 apps at a time 3 battery lasts for 24 hrs normal usefew shots and games 4 video playback is awesome with 34clear motion34 option  cons 1 sound quality is not so good while listening to music using headphone 2 some games dont touch 30 fpsframes per second didnt expect that from an octacore phone  overall its very good phone under 10k
4453	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	xolo omega 55 phone is good   pros 1 awesome camera 2 awesome resolution 3 awesome speaker 4 good performance 5 good touch 6 hive ui is great  i gave four star because of battery it taking too much time to full charge and drain battery within 45 hrs of 3g surfing  overall it is a good budget phone 
4454	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	best phone ever i seen amazing speed unbelievable video quality  great looks in low price 1 gb ram is more than enough for kitkat 44 battery life extends up to 2 days after power management get start power management appservice is inbuilt in this phone only the thing is it gets hot after playing heavy game but it8217s normal thanks xolo 
4455	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	previously i have been using a xolo q600 and believe me the formers quad core processor is almost the same as this ones octacore im quite disappointed with this mobile charging takes a lot of time full charge takes about 3 hrs from 0 to 100 plus the battery drains very quickly at least 3000 mah was required for this type of mobile another irritating fact is that the phone lags a few times while starting a game which is quite shocking for an octa core and lastly the fact which i hate the most the phone gets heated up while playing certain games at first i thought this was happening for playing large games like asphalt 8 but it happens every time while playing any game of size greater than 100 mb also the sound quality of the loud speaker is not good and quite low my xolo q600 was far better than this one i gave this a 3 star for the specifications only as performancewise it deserves only 2
4456	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	amazing product at this price range touch is awesome coupled with unreal good looks no problems in multitasking i was using samsung grand before buying this device trust me its millions times better and much more affordable dont think twice before buying
4457	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	its such a nice phone brilliant in looks and performance and the speed is good too battery and camera are also fantastic
4458	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	best phone in budget
4459	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	have no words to describe the work done by xolo phone cost 9000 works like 20000
4460	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	this phone hangs a lot battery heats up very often camera is 13 megapixels but image quality is very very poor front camera is a total disaster just bought 2 weeks ago and loaded only one mp3 song and one video and installed 4 apps and the phone cannot even run normally with this returning it back asap
4461	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	good product frol xolo camera is good and the screen optimization is also good
4462	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	amazing product from xolo for this budget camera is good too good deal
4463	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	company can compromise with camera by enhancing ram capacity
4464	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	having all features good but all get vain when battery drains rapidlymusic with head phone is not up to mark it can be compromise but not battery backupnot look like 2600 mah battery
4465	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	it is a good phone wen compared with price range
4466	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	omega 55 is ok but charge system is not stay long camera is ok in a night and aday one problem is created suddenly mobile is hanging and its touch not work
4467	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	not so good at this price of 8300
4468	Xolo Omega 5.5 (Black)	great fone under the budget  only regret is that unable to get the flip cover or back cover even in the market
4469	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	if you know and accept that this is going to be a large phone you will never go back to anything else  the phone is an absolute pleasure to use  i am discovering new features every day  the screen is probably the best ever put on a smartphone
4470	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	there are alot of reviews talking abt specs of this device hence i will not repeat that its my 3rd note device note 1 2 and 4 edge i was planning to not to continue with the streak but then i saw this device and it changed my mind i bought this device for rs 48000 this month it came with 444 which i upgraded 501 same dayits an amazingly smart device with great screen and smooth touch there are several features as small as using bio sensor to click selfies to use side screen for various features these are 2 different led screen which work independently why you shld buy it 1 great screen ppi 2 amazing touch 3 great sound 4 unique design 5 not using traditional plastic body 6 its one of the most stylist device in the market and trust if you carry it you will not go unnoticed i have been using this device for 3 weeks now and so far i am satisfiedso if you want a device as smart as you are go for iti just love it
4471	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	the note edge is a different phone altogether it has extremely thin design  thinner than i expected and features this unique extra glass on the side that you can use it for displaying useful information i hope more and more developers use this for showing extra information  i would love an app that  can display currency exchange rates on the sides  battery life is ok ok not as good as my note 3 blame more powerful innards foe this  camera quality is good enough but not great if you are taking pics under low light for that lumia 1520 and 1020 are the kings
4472	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	its the best phone i ever hadeven if it has a high price tagits worth it
4473	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	love my phone and have paired with gear s and gear circle innovation at its best

4476	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	the screen is probably the best ever put on a
4477	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	super cool phone
4478	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	quite disapointed too big too heavy battery life time is barely one day 8h
4479	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	camera camera iso is just 800 which is present in galaxy s2 as well  shutter speed is also comparatively low as this price low light shoot is pathetic wrt sony xperia z2 z3 and iphone yet to explore htc one m8 bluffed in terms of 1only mega pixel has been densed to project little brightnessexposure 2 camera apps have been provided to beat sony xperia z3 and nokia lumia 1520 not at all comparable with nokia lumia 1020 16mp has been left same as s5 iso 800 same shutter speed and note 4 iso 800 same shutter speed for their marketing smart ois as told by samsung was very much shaky with respect to iphone and xperia z3  speaker front boom sound speakersdown are missing which is obvious in htc and sonyiphone66 at least on this premium price samsung could have provided  battery for this high ppi of 534 and quad hd display with hugh 3 gb ram and cpu as power house with lots of sensors active and also in general we get to have approx 15 gb of normal applications installed and always logged in which keeps running as process in the background the battery judged and provided is very low i am not sure which experiment of samsung allowed it through production  if you open gps 3g4gthe 3000 mah battery judged and provided is very low display just drinks the battery and it will last not more than full day hour best would be lenovo vibe z2 pro and xperia z3 as of now in this category  i am a pro samsung user but i had to publish this i am happy with galaxy s2 with 768mb ram and facebook off and of course heavy games uninstalled to keep the battery for full day hour
4480	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	super phone but why samsung not showing mersy on price
4481	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	ha ha ha til now i didnt saw such type of funy things64000and only quad coreit should be octa core
4482	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	not working properly when the phone was locked it was automatically zooming so we should restart the phone again
4483	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	no cons  about this phone   value for money  plz dont ask any questions go for it if u can afford it
4484	Samsung Galaxy Note Edge (Black)	very very expensive and not at all worth of even 1000 rupee mobile
4485	Xolo A500 Club (White)	xolo a500 club is an upgrade to xolos already popular xolo a500 budget phone this device is mainly designed for music lovers with dual front facing speakers which is not common in device at this price range   specs display  480 x 800 pixels 40 inches 233 ppi   the viewing angles are oknot great processor  mediatek mt6572 chipset  dual core 13ghz processor  this processor is no powerhousebut can easily handle basic apps and games ram  512mb camera  5mp rear supports 720p recording vga front camera  the rear camera is a fixed focus cameraie no auto focus available  disappointing battery  1400mah  it would be hard to get one full day of backup with this power battery  xolo a500 club is one of the best well built budget phone the device doesnt looks cheap at all the back panel of the device is matte finishedgiving good grip and a premium feel  this runs on android 42 jellybean xolo opted for a customized ui instead of the stock ui you see in most of other xolo devices this custom ui is a mixed bagit looks good in some areas and bad in some other the default home screen doesnt have an app menuinstead all apps are spread out on the different homescreen however you can go back to the normal launcher style by changing it in the themes under settings  antutu benchmark score  10000  verdict overall a decent well built  budget device coming with front facing speakers only 3 stars given since it doesnt have an autofocus camera and the battery provided is a small one
4486	Xolo A500 Club (White)	this is not good camera is badmusic voice is low and quality is badprocessor is slowonly look is good ok
4487	Xolo A500 Club (White)	battery standby is not  good design nice  icons changes from its position to another by itself without our concern even while phone locked is very bad some times screen automatically zoom itself is very bad
4488	Xolo A500 Club (White)	i got it for my mom wanted her to learn to use a smartphone this was just the right choice i believe as i got this for 5 grants and xolo as a brand is quite trustworthy when it comes to quality people call me a brand ambassador of xolo as i have almost convinced more than 18 people around my friend circle to buy and trust meeveryone is very happy with the the phone  coming to this one it was a gamble to buy this phone as its new i have tried the xolo a500s and that was good but the look and the front acing speakers and the price 5k was all very attractive to me when i wanted it as a gift purpose  after receiving themy gamble seemed to have payed off quite well the looks are stunning and the front facing dual speakers gives a very nice music effect music doesnt appear to be muffled as it is when the speaker grill is on the back side listing down the features i liked  62 the phone look and display are very attractive specially the white one 62 music is good 62 no lags found in the transition of the pages and quite smooth 62 processor and ram is adequate for daily use 62 battery saver inbuilt its enough to take you throughout the day provided your not doing heaving wifi and graphic usage  features i did not quite like  62 the camera is not something to praise about pictures appear flushed and details missing but thats fine you cant expect good camera in a 5k phone front camera is ok for a vga 62 transition through the menu has a issue which i am unable to resolve the transition of the menu page icons are random there is a way to change the settings from the menu but even after changing we cant see the change they still appear random 62 the ui is like the iphone ui the stock android ui like nexus which was in the previous xolo models was cool and fast  overall its a nice phone for some who wants a basic android phone for just 5k i wont say i am as impressed as a500s but yea this phone does the job  cheers
4489	Xolo A500 Club (White)	i purchased this phone for my mother who has never used a touch phone before and she has never used her phone for anything more than making or receiving calls so i wanted to buy a touch phone which was simple to use and very reasonably priced this is the one which was recommended by a friend of mine and i totally agree with his recommendation  my mom is very happy with this phone and so am i

4491	Xolo A500 Club (White)	good i am happy using the phone for last six months or more phone is good considering the price only problem which i found is the battery back up which is pathetic with heavy usages it lasts only for 3 to 4 hours sometimes even below that if you are gaming apart from this the phone is good
4492	Xolo A500 Club (White)	super but battery is very bad it wont last one day if we use internet we will get battery backup only for 1 hour if we use internet a little bit lag is there and the handset is over heating camera and flash is very bad we can use it and we can say that i we too has smartphone
4493	Xolo A500 Club (White)	amazon is the best online shipping company and amazons one day delivery service is nice id really like amazonin and xolo a500club is very nice phone in price of near 5000 rsits the best featureable and nice looking phone
4494	Xolo A500 Club (White)	only 1 prob bad pic quality in the house i ve expected more rest all is fine gud for those who dont want to click ny pic inhouse
4495	Xolo A500 Club (White)	nice mobile and cheap and best touch sensitive is awesome then working performance also very nice compare to shop and amazon 2000 rupees differnts
4496	Xolo A500 Club (White)	its really a wonderful experience to make purchase on amazonin really its superb specially for the fulfilled order expecting more n more value added services from amazon
4497	Xolo A500 Club (White)	excellent phone with value for money hats off to xolo and amazon both for giving me a such a good product and service you both exceeded my expectationsgreat
4498	Xolo A500 Club (White)	bought xolo mobile from amazone m r sales after one month while charging circuit got burned now the repair center parel 9east is asking rs 4000 to repair it even though its within time frame of warranty its a cheating scam which is going on between xolo dealer and amozon
4499	Xolo A500 Club (White)	1sound mp3video sound not clear 2little bit touch problem in back button  options button 3quality issue in scratch cards 4other things ok
4500	Xolo A500 Club (White)	weight 450 kilograms what do amazon mean by this they just dumped the details without understanding now one has to doubt about other specs also
4501	Xolo A500 Club (White)	best procduct  nd best mobile phone i like amzone site because best price in amzon nd best prodct i like this prodct
4502	Xolo A500 Club (White)	nice phone maza aa gaya kam price main jyada maza  bahut acha mobile hai jo bhi lena chahe jarur le
4503	Xolo A500 Club (White)	it seems lava xolo do not have any quality assurance department and i seriously doubt if they test the product even once before mobile leaves their factory i found several thin black vertical lines appeared in the lcd when started the mobile very first time and these lines kept increasing each day display become pathetic in 5 days  mobile is no more in usable condition
4504	Xolo A500 Club (White)	at 6300 bucks it has an ips display dual speakers with good sound quality decent camled flash is useless front cam great looks very thin and light supports both micro and miniregular sims micro sd slot and a great finishbetter than some higher end phones like moto g etc what else do you want at this price
4505	Samsung Galaxy A3 (White)	the samsung galaxy a3 is the junior member of the companys new metalclad lineup the least likely one to challenge the alphadog but just as slim and sharp as the rest of its galaxy a teammates  and its not all about the looks  with lte and super amoled available across the range the samsung galaxy a3 has the same 64bit chipset as the a5 and the same highres front camera as the a7 most of the other specs are of course duly toned down but the a3 is a pretty credible midrange package on its own  it comes in single and dualsim flavors which is a popular combo in the midrange  but does well to offer cat 4 lte on both  the highresolution selfie camera is still quite a novelty for samsung  the a3 is among the few very recent phones to have one  a super amoled screen of qhd resolution and a 4534 diagonal and a snapdragon 410 chipset under the hood are looking competitive enough  main disadvantages    on the pricey side at launch   relatively low resolution display   nonremovable battery   dual sim model has less ram than the singlesim model and no nfc   the second sim slot on the dual sim model doubles as a microsd slot so you can only use it with a sim card or a microsd card but not both simultaneously  where the galaxy a3 comes short is display resolution however the super amoled display should make up for the relatively low fidelity with great contrast and punchy colors  the snapdragon 410 chip which isnt going to break the sound barrier but is of the new 64bit generation and wont be dealing with too much stress considering the screen resolution it packs enough oomph for a midranger and things will only get better when samsung are done with the android 50 lollipop update
4506	Samsung Galaxy A3 (White)	great phone very good camera only prob is once hanged it cant be reset

4531	Lenovo A5000 (Black)	ive been using this phone for exactly a week now and purchased it mainly for its battery life however im pleasantly surprised at how good this phone has turned out to be the phone has a premium look to it and a screen guard and basic phone cover protecting the back is included in the original packing i can vouch for the battery which lasts for 152 days on heavy to medium usage with wifi and mobile data being switched on all the time the touch screen is as good as any android phone including the nexus 5 in terms of responsiveness to touch and ease of typing etc even though the ram is only 1gb i havent faced any lag or slowness is using or switching between apps the internal memory is 8gb and almost all of it is available for installing apps downloading music videos photos etc the phone runs on android 44 kitkat customised by lenovo and is expected to get the lollipop update soon audio quality is very good if you use nice earphones the one supplied with the phone is pretty basic and i use skullcandy earphones to listen to music the only drawback  i find is in the camera where image quality is nowhere close to nexus 5 same 8mp or apple iphone 4s maybe 5mp however im yet to see a sub 10k mobile phone which clicks great pictures the camera isnt awful by any means though it is passable and efficient and the quality really suffers only in low light all in all id say its a great buy if your budget is around 10k

4563	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	hi  i got a new gionee m2 white 8gb delivered on october 12th the phone didnt start after charging for almost 1 hour sad and disappointed with the faulty product i had to ask amazon for a refund i hope other people dont suffer something like this i was so happy that i will have a new phone before i leave town for a vacation but now i have to go without a phone and it has ruined my vacation i really didnt expect such bad service i am waiting for the refund and i hope amazon takes strict action against faulty product sellers
4564	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	i am using the 4gb version since april and very happy with the set its usp is battery which lasts more than 2 days in heavy usage and around 3 days in normal which makes it bit bulky if you want a light phone then dont cry while charging it every 12 hrs it is the price you have to pay for powerful battery only 2 cons i faced so far first  display viewing angle on top is not good and second the default widgets dont work on 3rd party launcher but works on miui  i use doodle launcher and it gives the phone a great look other than that great value for money it never hangs or heat up love it
4565	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	in the product specification its weight is only 122 gm but the actual product i got is very heavy it weighs more than 12 kilo one sim slot is micro sim but it was not mentioned in the specification  xolo q 900 which i had earlier was more slim and more beautiful
4566	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	performance as expected wow battery life no lags and the picture quality is also good for this price range no lags in heavy graphics gamesvery satisfied works like a charm
4567	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	superb mobile with great features i am very impressed with the features  performance of the phone extra smooth touch screen awesome look powerful battery no need to worry about battery or carry a powerbank phone itself is powerbank 8gb internal memory 8 mp camera 1gb ram  comes with good quality cover  screen guardi was like wowww  no mobile company provides there great features in 10k price  very unique features have been given by gionee thanks gionee i did not expect these features in 10k this phone has given me beyond expectation i am user of expensive cell phones  but i am very much happy for this purchase  first time i got value for money in mobile  looking to buy one more as a gift ideal product  good seller  thanks amazon got it delivered within 24 hrs
4568	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	 main highlights 1 4200mah battery  can easily last 2 days of very heavy usage 2 quadcore  mtk6582m processor 3 1 gb ram 4 android 42 jellybean update  m2 is gonna get kitkat update  4200mah battery is unheard in a device shipping at this price range the other 2 handsets that ships with similar battery are lenovo p780 and xolo q3000but both are priced much higher than this due to the huge battery it needs to accommodatethe device is bulky and a little heavier than other smartphones the display is a 5 inch one with a resolution of 480 x 854 pixelswhich is not that greatbut ok the viewing angles are also not that great the processorgpu combination is powerful enough to play many of the games without much issues and the jellybean on board runs smooth gionee has opted to ship this with a custom ui instead of android stock ui   some misc info this is a dual sim phone  one is the normal sim slot while the other is a micro sim slot otg is not supported sensors on board  accelerometermagnetic sensorlight sensorproximity sensororientation sensors capacitive buttons are not backlighted always   camera impressive for the price 8mp rear camera takes good pictures when it comes to video departmentthis can shoot 1080p videos at 30fps  benchmark scores quadrant  5800 antutu  17200 nenamark 2  55fps   verdict  overall a great handset with a huge battery that can easily last 2 days of heavy usereal value for money this one is an 8gb editionthere are 4gb editions available on amazon priced a lil lesser
4569	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	i brought this product from amazon great service got in 1 day when i got this phone i was really happy because this was my first android phone this phone does its job very well this phone has a huge battery backup if i play games and do surfing and whatsapp and fb continuously even then it battery lasts for full 1 day any other phone below rs30000 will be dead in 89hrs i have some high intensive games on it like asphalt 8 mc4 nfs mw the dark knight rises etc and all work fine although i have experienced 12 phone hangs but its common with android mobiles camera is averagely good but camcorder is poor resolution doesnt make much of difference in daily use it plays 1080p movies very well and also have some additional features which you will not find in other smart phones like each and every app and its data is movable to external sd card overall this is best phone in its price range after asus zenfone 5 it wasnt released when i brought this mobile and also it remains out of stock all time so close your eyes and go for it 
4570	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	be careful weight of 122 grams is without battery also gionee has not provided any android os updates whatsoever  so basically you will be stuck to 42 till the time you use this phone i also did not like its screen clarity and the app icons appear very rough only advantage is the battery back up it lasts long  net net at around 10k this phone is a waste there are better options available at lesser price
4571	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	good mobile good battery life good camera internal memory screen price average music system i bought it for my wifeso its very large mobile and she cant keep it in her pocket so she gives it to me to keep it safe in my pocketthats the drawback of this mobile for melol by the way good service by amazon
4572	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	very good mobile and super long life battery that is amazing  dont hesitate if you like the config and the appearance go for it its worthy
4573	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	when u rate something u rate based on price you paying and the services you have got from the product  i wanted to give m2 35 rating  the only flaw in the phone is its camera even at 105k we deserve better camera output built quality is decent n battery backup great it just goes on n on  not sure if u can travel comfortably with the heavy phone but some people can so its personel choice
4574	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	superb mobile nice battery backup look not so bad bit bulky received the parcel yesterday only i must say packaging is not upto the mark
4575	Gionee M2 (White, 8GB)	cons screen is tft is big problem in some angle view is not clear n blackish pros battery is good music is good

4611	Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (Black)	good product but amazon is selling it at a very high price when its much cheaper offline
4612	Samsung Galaxy Note 4 (Black)	superb phone with mind blowing features rocking performance its a privilege to own a phone like this hats off to samsung
4613	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	the phone is awesome  with side loading saps the experience is fantastic       the actual warranty by blackberry is 15 yrs for the hardware ie handset but why is the sellers here mention 1yr manufacturers warranty 
4614	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	having used this phone for a week now below is my review  pros  smooth lagfree ui phone hasnt hanged till date and current uptime 62 5 days  gestures i loved it once you get used to it youll miss gestures in every phone  most of the android apps are supported google maps and hangout didnt work for me via amazon1mobile appstores you cant tell if an app is android sideloaded or native bb ive tested candycrush and templerun2 they run lagfree im not into games at all  bb hub youll have to use it to appreciate it see youtube videos  build i liked the overall build quality of this phone it looks classy this is my personal opinion  cons  biggest battery doesnt last even a day im a heavy user and have synced all my accounts including my corporate email  hot during datasync during initial data sync contactemail the phone got hot to the level that i was worried if i should replace the device but it was one time i havent faced the issue again  google talk from bb world isnt working for me and since hangoutgoogletalk cant be side loaded i dont have googletalk on my phone it is a big miss for me there are thirdparty apps android which connect to googletalk apis but i wanted google talk to integrate with bb hub
4615	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	i got this device for rs17985 i received the product within 2 days would like to give 5 stars for the delivery and the products manufacturing date was of march 2014 so thank you to gadgetdirect for giving me the product from latest stock and device is just brilliant using 3rd party apps made the phone more brilliant intalled many android apps but the only drawback of this device is that there is no google maps app in the app world and no blackberry maps for this country overall a great device for business users
4616	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	its been 2025 daysno complaintworking fabulously tried installing android apps like google map working fine best for non android freak
4617	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	there cant be a worse phone than this i have bought this phone around 5 months ago and let me share my reviews regarding its usage 1 in 2 months its vibrator motor has gone bad and my phone doesnt vibrate and i have to keep my phone on general always to get an alert for the call 2 i am a professional an attend a lot of conference calls those who do the same understands the importance of 34mute34 button mute button in this phone is malfunctioned if u go for mute for a long time and then if you want to unmute you cant 3 recently after 4 months of the purchase if wifi connection has also gone for a toss it doesnt connect wifi 4 overall lagging is not there but there is no point if these basic features doesnt work phone came to me in rs 18k and i was pretty happy with it as i thought in this much money i have got the maximum configurations  there cannot be a lesser rating than 1 otherwise i would have given that to this product i am highly disappointed as i hav invested 18k in this phone which is having so many problems
4618	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	after so much of thinking and reviews decided to get myself the z10 got it at 15990 and a brand new box piece made in mexico in may 2014 beginning to like it am a normal user and when my android started to slow down i wanted a phone which is fast and responsive i guess blackberry would be my answer phone so far looks good and feels good yet to explore more  update after 13 days  i feel bad now as the phones speaker stopped working so i sent it back for full refund but having experienced blackberry now booked a q10 and waiting for it hopefully its a better piece
4619	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	got z10 from amazon 2 weeks back a great phone for people who want to use as a work phone and not for playing with use less apps operating system is very good and intuitive i think one of the best which can be compared with ios i have been a blackberry user for years and was little reluctant to switch to touchscreen but the keyboard is amazing wont have much problem if u are switching from a keyboard phone  a good buy
4620	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	you will get a new mobile experiencethe multitasking sweeps any task in secondsits abt one month and no issues wat so everthe camera is one of a kind takes wonderful picturesit looks and feels goodcall quality is amazing and many claim that the battery life is worstbut its not that worst it lasts a full day of normal useafter the recent os update the battery life is boosted and the support will be great by blackberrythis phone receives all the updates in timedo trust this guys it is such a pleasure to use this phone
4621	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	with prices as half as top notch android phone this is a clever buyloaded with blackberry os 10 this gives a great user experience and no signs of slowness or sluggish performancewith amazon appstore available this gives the user apps and games from both blackberry and android world   only concern is the battery lifethough this is a concern if you are connected to the internet whole day and an active user in terms of emailswhatsappyou have to have charger before end of day to feel better   overall a great phone
4622	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	i got to learn about this phone from a close friend who had recently ordered it from amazon her said there service is amazing but i had to double check from the market to know this and he was right online deals here are amazing because outside i was getting it for 17000 lowest  performance is amazing  fast  music quality  good with blackberry earphones ultimate with high end ones camera is awesome with incredible filters features are incredible especially the accuweather and compass there is no radio from the start you can download it battery backup  better than android phones disable internet and you can go for 1 and a half days it has an led to show notifications this is a wonderful phone and i am happy that i bought it
4623	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	the main on off button does not respond it was a birthday gift  and now i have take to take it to the nearest bb centre to get it fixed this is the third bb i have purchased and every time i have had issues with the bb i guess the  qc team at bb is asleep or using other mobiles for their personal use ive been a bb fan all along  however its time to make a change i guess  other than these issues  its the best mobile i like to work with
4624	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	lovely interface and lightening fast navigation with battery being the only downside which could be compromised for such a good product
4625	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	my first blackberry phone and my experience with this phone is really very good till now since im using it for more than two months user interface blackberry hub keypad its new operating system camera call quality pictures video every thing is just working great without any issues battery capacity is little low but its what a 1700mah battery will do side loading of androids app is helpful all that makes this a wonderful package
4626	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	a good phone to have with lots of negetive and positive features  blackberry claims that android apps works on bb10 but most of them are usless if you download them  from 3rd party app stores like most of indian bank apps expect icici bank app phones speed is okay not great camera works great but very less features battry is okay  overall a good phone if you can get it around15 to 17k
4627	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	first of all thanks to amazonin for very fast delivery and good packaging of product except battery life every this is extraordinary after updating 102 you can even run android applications very smoothly
4628	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	its a great phone if you are tired of android platform and have an affinity towards blackberry only issue is nonavailability of few apps mainly gmail application to manage all the mails easily although phone will get synced with gmail account but it is easier to manage and label mails through an app rather than blackberry hub feature great battery and seamless functioning
4629	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	great product and service in this price its a great phone  i recommend to go for it i have bought in rs15250
4630	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	awesome phone till the time battery lasts i was using a bb earlier then someone suggested me to shift to android crap mistake well corrected by purchasing z10 only big issue is the battery backup has to charge it twice in a day
4631	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	i got a phone with a best pack nd covered its having high class performance we cant compare it with apple bt its far better den android the only problem i faced is when i used to talk on skype and along with it if i keep mob on charging den also batt gets low else to get charged whats the reason behind dat still m in search of that
4632	BlackBerry Z10 (Charcoal Black)	everything is fantastic in this mobile except battery need to improve the capacity of the battery
4633	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	first of all i didnt received any amazon gift voucher worst experience but this phone is all in one a budget kitkat phone battery lasts whole day i m playing subway surfer nd temple run and gta 3 with no lag thanks to amazon and micromax
4634	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	good product at low cost android phone  within a week of purchase i found some malfunctioning in the battery that was not giving the backup after the full charging  i contacted the service centre who has replaced with new battery  and working very fine
4635	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	nice mobile in low price android kitkat 442 and 512mb of ram  at price point of view this is just unbeatable battery lasts whole day while playing  playing games nd while using internet based on ur usage
4636	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	i have been using the phone for the last 1 month and this is what my experiences with it pros 1 mali 400 gpu coupled with dual core cpu from mediatekk based on a7 runs all games smoothly including asphalt 8 and mc4 at optimal settings without any glitch 2excellent battery backup which lasts for about 2 days with average usages 3dont hangs up although occasionaly there are some slowdowns during multitasking 4apps can directly be installed in the external memory card this is a big advantage as the phone comes with just 185 gb usable internal memory cons 1below average camera qualityprimary camera is worst than vga quality and secondary camera can be barely used even in daylight 2worst screen quality and viewing angles 3poor speakers 4poor build quality some wirings are exposed when opening battery cover 5only 512 mb ram although the phone never slows down 6 no 3g verdict it is a good value for product at the entry level budgeta powerful software and hardware combo at a very low price if the below average screen quality and cameras can be overlooked
4637	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	i had purchase this mobile from amazonin and in the specification of this mobile it has shown 3g is their but now i have this phone i cannot see anyway to use 3g in this phone i am very disappointed
4638	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	this product was quite ok but its delivery time was something little bit late and offcourse packaging was beautiful and awesome
4639	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	this mobile is having everything you basically needs in a budget device but on top of that you got kitkat 442 and 512mb of ram and at this price point it is just unbeatable
4640	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	this phone was perfect gift to my mom age  50 resolution is not that great like that of high end phones but that is expected and is neither too bad camerafront is worst only reason due to which i gave 4 rating is the bad front camera what is the purpose of having a front camera that gives shy pics under normal lighting conditionsdont think itll be any good while using skype what i want to say is that you could have removed this feature  reduced the price  otherwise this phone has met all of my expectations of a lowend small but good looking smartphone with touch screen
4641	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	excellent mobile phone on lowest price very smooth n sexy latest android kitkat is feather in d cap very user friendly no hang on n good battery backup
4642	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	i bought a micromax bolt a064 but its one of the earphone doesnt work so i want a new earphone without replacing the entire product
4643	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	display showing emergency calls onlythis was the only phone with good rating after all my research in this websitebut turned into a nightmarepeople get tempted by seeing the phonebut after all my researchi think the android phones are the worst phones in the worldthe ratings  reviews itself shows its facei think its time to file a public litigation
4644	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	this monile is amazing good perfomance and good working also good cleaeity i suggest ro buy this mobile
4645	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	micromax delivered superb mobile phone at very low price like it nice speed at 512 ram

4647	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	best android phone on a budget with sufficient memory features battery life etc
4648	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	nice mobile in under 4k  amazon delivery was nice and no problem till now
4649	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	really feeling awful  and this will be my last purchase from amazon you cheated me giving the third quality piece sim 1 was not working i became so fed up that i was not even interested  for a return any way good bye amazon
4650	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	third class product one sim was not readingafter sometime i was unable to open mobile as it was automatically rooted and lost all software i will advise friends not to buy micromax mobiles
4651	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	i bought it for my dad but he seems not much happy with itsize is small n touch is also not soo good i wud have bought moto e or lumia 630 rather then this price of crap
4652	Micromax Bolt A064 Black	best phone in this price range had all the necessary features playing allmost all types of videos and supporting games the pre installed apps are good but some are useless there is a slight problem in wall papers they are coming in stretched mode no 3g its the major con cam quality is ok but not super and all the others are just fine its an a product sound comes with good clarity battery backup is also good
4653	Karbonn Wind W4 (Red)	dont expect more its good fast nd yes to me it was more than my expectation
4654	Karbonn Wind W4 (Red)	the karbonn  titanium wind w4 is the cheapest windows 81 phone we can buy anywhere in the world its available for anywhere between 2751 to 4000 rs and at that price range its far beyond my expectations  for own it has close to the same specifications as a nokia 520 or even the nokia 430 and 435 its dual sim supposedly win 10 compatible and supports 3g agps bluetooth wifi and all the functionality one expects from a modern smartphone its only 512 mb ram and 4 gb  storage but expandable by a 32 gb sd card and windows phone works just fine on half a gig of ram  the phone works as one would expect   smooth and pretty responsive there are some issues with the limited space and when theres no external sd it runs out of space and the data connection fails also while decently made its not the most sturdy phone and some care should be taken with it just getting a decent case should be adequate  overall at the cost of a starter phone its a brilliant device that i still dont believe even exists its far better than a htc mozart which i paid 27 for less than 4 years ago at one tenth the cost of any mainstream smartphone i cant understand how this device isnt more popular
4655	Karbonn Wind W4 (Red)	super look

4703	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	within 2 months three buttons are not working  i bought the same product from an outlet i was so much satisfied for the first 2 months after 2 months the 3 buttons just below the screen started troubling me back button google button and options button and at the time i am posting this all these three buttons are not working i am very much pissed of by this now its damn hard to use this mobile  within 2 months three buttons are not working
4704	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	before this phone i had galaxy s3 which got stolen in auto expo after that i waited nearly for 5 months before buying this beauty i am very much satisfied with this product this phones battery performance is far far better than s3 especially the battery backup it easily lasts more than one day from night to morning it hardly loses 2 juice which was not the same with s3 its custom ui emotion ui is just awesome it is different from all other android phones so if u r thinking which phone to buy then without any doubt u can buy this and no need to worry about the service centres there are nearly 30 service centres in india and if you have doubt about brand huawei then please do a google search u will be amazed know about huawei  and one more thing buy a screen guard as the screen is fingerprint magnet

4709	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	only drawback is the sound quality and accessories provided within box not even a screen guard is supplied along  razak
4710	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	lot of heat gets generated while callingbrowsingcharging rest all features and performance is very good but heating problem is scary sometimes

4712	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	so i had a huawei ascend g600 and it was just a mind blowing phone slipped off my hands hundreds of times and had a wonderful 8 mp camera that was just perfect and the sound was good too it was so perfect that i was bored with that and due to low specs i had to sell it to get a better 34high end34 phone i assumed this phone 3c cannot be a wrong choice as it is from huawei and has spectacular specsi was so wrong the 8 mp camera isnt great sound sucks and  the phone is not even close to having 2gb ram or a multiple core processor when you load contacts it will take forever smart dial keep waiting for it to show the relevant contact ad just too slow for a 2giigs device the phone is durable stands fall from height is very good looking but doesnt deliver or is not even close to the specs advertised it has just been a few months and i already get all androidprocess shut down errors i think i should switch to motorola now
4713	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	fantastic phone value for money  i bought this phone a fortnight back was a little worried since it is a chinese phone but ordered it through amazone  i have been using all kinds of phones since the time cellphones were introduced in india including a number of high end phones this is really good  my only crib is that the volume of the phone could have been better  i also ordered a hard back cover for this phone ie nillikin frosted hard back cover with scratch guard some how the scratch guard was a bit folded on the corner and could not be installed on the phone with out bubbles i took up the  issue with amazon and with in a few days  they send me a fresh one that is high standard of  bussiness ethics seldom seen in our country  hats off to nillkin  it is really worth buying it it adds to the beauty of the phone and gives added protection iam not saying it because they gave me a new piece but the stuff is really classy
4714	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	a superb  stylish phone which meets all my requirements i m fully satisfied with its performance speed and battery life realy an intelligent purchase the only thing i didnt like is there is no light in backhomemenu button  the phone dont have logo of huawei
4715	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	been using this phone for 6 months now and very happy with it the ui is different from regular android phones very customisable and not at all gimmicky battery backup is very good  easily lasts for an entire day the specs are amazing given the price range i would definitely recommend this phone over a samsung or htc havent faced any problems so far the only negative point i can think of is that the three buttons on the bottom panel do not light up its not a dealbreaker though true cases and covers are not easily available but i found some nice colourful ones on ebay plus i hear the kitkat update will be coming soon so no reason not to go for it 
4716	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	the features are good in its price range but the sound quality of speakers are really irritable its not at all audiblevery low so i dont recommend this device
4717	Huawei Honor Hol-U19 (Black and White)	cool set 1 battery backup is good huawei provides an inbuilt optimizer 2 camera quality is very goodboth the cameras 3 screen quality is also very good 4 performance is excellent as expected because of 2 gb ram provided 5 had no problem in running high end games 6 it comes with dts sound technology which incredibly boosts quality of the the music cinema and voice all in all best phone at this price range

4766	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual (White)	xperia ultra t2 is a mini version of sonys expensive and premium phablet xperia ultra  60 device specs  highlights 62   display  720p screen 60 inches 245 ppi pixel density  triluminos display and mobile bravia engine 2 are included to get a better viewing experience the display quality is good offering good viewing angles and the touch response is great the screen is reflectivewhich means you might find it difficult to see under direct sunlight   chipset  qualcomm msm8928 snapdragon 400  quadcore 14 ghz cortexa7 cpu  not a high end processorbut powerful enough to offer a lag free experience adreno 305 gpu helps in good gaming performance  ram  1gb ram ensures good multitasking many devices at this price range has started to offer 2gb ram so pretty disappointed that this only has 1gb on board considering the price at which this is sold   nonremovable liion 3000 mah battery  with this big batterythe device can easily last one day of moderate usage   build quality  performance the build quality of the device is goodbut different from other sony higher end flagship device even though it is plasticthe overall look of the device doesnt look cheap at all the back panel is very glossythe performance of the device is also quite good the processorgpu combination can power up many high end games without much issuesbut for some you need to put the graphics level to medium to get smooth gaming experiencethe same cpugpu combination is seen in devices like galaxy note 3 neo huawei ascend mate 2htc desire 816 etc   software this is running android 43 jellybean and sony is plans to upgrade it to android 44 kitkat the ui is closed to stock androidexcept some useful modifications from sony since the ui is not heavylike samsungs touchwiz the overall experience is lag free most of the time   camera 13 mp rear camera that supports 1080p video recording at 30fps 11 mp 720p recording  30fps is supported  overall quality of the camera is oknot very good or not very badgood enough for your sharing needs it offers many modes seen in other sony phones like superior auto timeshift ar effects background defocussweep panorama etc superior auto mode is limited to take 9mp photos only though expect washed outnoisy below average photos indoors and in low light   some things to note 1 micro sim 2 applications cannot be moved to the sdcard so you are limited with the 43 gb out of 8gb internal storage to install apps and games 3 speaker volume is not high 4 usb otg is supported 5 nfc support is there   verdict overall a good midrange phablet from sony with an excellent screen and good battery backup this is not that powerful as its big brother xperia ultra and only has 1 gb of ram if you want a big branded device this is a good one to get if size doesnt matter to you i would suggest getting a moto x which is coming at the same price point offering good performance and software features if brand is not an issue for you then you can find a lot of indian branded devices with competitive specs in this price range
4767	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual (White)	first thing you feel after opening the box  i received mine today and i used it with iball keyboard cover and its like mini laptop in front of me i will say black62white62purple interms of color because of the size and gender of the user camera bravo front camera is also very good and caters nicely on vdcht body is not that strong compare to z series but still ok types its a dual sim and processor is so potent i didnt feel any thing like network congestion call miss call drop etc  battery big phone big battry life is superb took only 58 in whole day even after all sorts of usages like gaming downloading installations and updates  over all its a 4 star it would have been 5 star had it been dust and water resistant  but still be cautioned  i am returning mine because  the back body cover was found bulged and it may be anything swollen battery body deformity  anything  so please give it a thought when you venture 225k into online mobile purchasing
4768	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual (White)	not satisfactory keeping price at the point of view  if you are going to purchase it of rs 25000 budget even thou you will have to take another camera at funtion party its camera is qualiity is not good it has g lens  exmor sensor which we get in dslr camera but even thou its quality is bad then the normal carl zesis lenses  for this i am going to sell this mobile on olxand will go for the samsung in the same range  secondly speaker is single you will not get the stereo feeling  dolby  and even the single sided speaker has also not good sound its like fm sound   rather than this two drawback all are good about it
4769	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual (White)	i am really disappointed with the product voice clarity and signal strength the voice clarity when you talk to someone is not clear at allalso the phone has to be frequently switched on and off in case you are travelling  the speaker is very bad quality compared to i phone the phone camera shows a lot of lag when clicking and saving photos  internal memory is too low at 6 gb after 9 months of usage  my phone hearing speaker is  not functioning properly and went defective today i am really disappointed and will not go for a sony device in future just wondering how will i get hold of warranty
4770	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual (White)	sony xperia t2 ultra is the best handset to handle the people those who like big screen and slim phones this handset is the best  butthe people who like best performance like processing smooth touching it is little bit uncomfortable the camera is best as compared other phones except z series

4772	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual (White)	as a sony brand phone  little disappointed currently running the latest kit kat  normal upgrade 1 the phone book access is awfully slow i think the processor is under powered 2 the single push buttom for the screen capture as well as power button is annoying 3the camera seems to be ok i am not getting sharp photos  like from a sony 4the lack of removable battery pack is a big negative cannot do hard reset by removing the power pack what happens when the power pack needs replacement  well  it may be it is my unit only
4773	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual (White)	it should be provided with free insurance and any other offers like free bluetooth headset or portable charger not worth buying it online  send me any gift lik bluetooth headset or portable charger

4776	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual (White)	ultimate smartphone   no  conss  all pros
4777	Sony Xperia T2 Ultra Dual (White)	i researched a lot about having the maximum screen time on one charge of the battery because talk time doesnt matter on smart phones and this had one of the most screen on times of 10 hours continuously hence even on heavy usage it comes for 2 days without having to search for your charger the perfect balance of specs and battery for the price

4801	Micromax Bolt A064 (White)	i bought it because i wanted to buy the cheapest android phone to use as a spare i use it just for calls a little bit of facebook  whatsapp the biggest benefit i got is that as i used the same google account on my other phone  this the contacts are always synched i can save a number on any of my phone  find it on other automatically  pros does not hang at all its fast with my limited usage with single sim and wifi always on the battery lasts for more than 3 days white colored textured back panel looks sexy  cons too tiny screen makes typing difficult micromax should provide a old nokia kind of t9 keyboard ads in notification panel coming from a native app cant find a way to stop this  neutral 2mp back cam and vga front cam is a handy utility to have but micromaxs 2mp quality is poorer than xiaomi samsung sony dont expect to take selfies to post online or tour photography call sound quality loudspeaker music quality fm reception is satisfactory for the price screen is good does not flicker at all but vertical viewing angle is not that great
4802	Micromax Bolt A064 (White)	nice product good delivery by amazon it works really great i have been using it since 8 months the touch was very good the ram was great and storage also it was a great piece for low price
4803	Micromax Bolt A064 (White)	i was able to buy this phone for my mom as a  bday gift with just some left overs of my 2 months pocket p money  i was not saving for this phone or  any phone  i just saw this in the deals page yesterday  btw yes i did get it in one day as i opted for it this is phone is not for people who use 3g mobile internet this phone does not support 3g network but what it does offer other than that is pretty amazing for the price i bought it  i dont want to set your hopes or expectation high  the pice changes the perspective of the experience having said that if you are going to buy this mobile for 3k or less i guarantee you will be happy with what it gives you if not please dont buy it 13 ghz dual core processor 512mb ram 4gb rom 1gb for app installation 12 gb user usable other allocated for system kit kat out of the box and front cam p  the camera and display is okay  not bad or good the display also performs good and the color recreation was quite accurate satisfactory for 3k  one thing to be noted is that the headset inside the box it looks and feels cheap what can i expect for the amount i paid its okay not that bad the phone comes with preloaded with a lot apps you know the micromax stuff and in addition to that was hike and clean master i would have rooted and  deleted it all its not mine so i just disabled everything that is useless my favorite file manager is es file manager but i faced problem while writing data to the sd card i got a prompt that the phone denied the permission to write and it can be fixed only by rooting p what the heck but other functions like net manger and other stuff works the inbuilt file manger works on both the sd cards this phone did surprise me by playing 1080p videos without lags and heating and seeking was pretty fast too   using mx player without custom codec or speed hacks it just worked i didnt benchmark its good enough it has proved what it can do the sensors work flaw less people who have big hands will find it difficult to use its a small cute phone there is a scratch guard inside the box i dont know the type of glass the phone has but it is better to use the freebie i dont use scratch guards my phone has coring glass i dont know about this is  and finally the price of the gift doesnt matter  what matters is that i was able to a get mobile with my leftovers and i received it on the very next day of placing the order for my mom and sorry for the big story above p
4804	Micromax Bolt A064 (White)	have been using this phone for quite a while now very nice not too heavy not much in the way of photography but didnt expect it to be the colour is white so a little easy to get dirty if you are not using a case for it otherwise no complaints really  its actually worth the price for which it is being sold on the note of compatibility i did face issues in installing a few dictionary software in the phone also a few wall papers were not compatible understandable based on their resolution and the resolution compatibility it has the power to support so no real concern there the other software like watsapp antivirus and games get uploaded pretty fine and works well
4805	Micromax Bolt A064 (White)	works excellent internal memory for apps15gb which is good no lags does everything it says good touch good flash light only front camera not upto the mark but what the heck what would you get for 3k totally worth it

4807	Micromax Bolt A064 (White)	i brought this phone 22nd feb still now cant set the 3g on and setting wallpaper is not easyas it appears in very zoomed form than the one we set front camera is not up to mark as it is lower in quality than what we expect form a 03mp  rest is so for good the phone is good for the costbut consider other models of same rate too

4820	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	i have been using this phone for the last few days and so far it has been a satisfactory experience  pros 1 adequate processing power there is no lag in opening any application even after a number of applications have been opened and closed 2 display is nice and color balance is very good the default display setting is rather dark so you need to increase the brightness and tweak one or two other options to get a very crisp display 3 audio quality is excellent i have a huge collection of 320kbps mp3 files and im playing them one after the other ever since i got the phone there are a number of sound tweaking options which really enhance your listening experience 4 the phone updated itself to firmware version 151c117 soon after i installed the pc suite the upgrade process was lengthy but automated and completely hassle free  cons 1 only 4gb of internal memory this should have been 8gb but i have purchased a 32gb transcend micro sd card class 4 so i havent felt any memory crunch yet 2 viewing angles are not very good 3 sony installs any number of completely useless apps you have to go on uninstalling or disabling them one by one i had not even heard of some of the apps that came preinstalled  overall i would say that for this price point it is a superb phone it handles very nicely display is crisp and audio playback is excellent i am rating it 4 only because of the useless preinstalled apps otherwise id have given a 5
4821	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	before i get to the phone first about amazon delivery i had a never before experience with amazon the external packaging was very poor and i was surprised not to see any sort of cushioning provided for the phones actual sony packaging i wanted to reject the product by not accepting from the amazon delivery person but i had to because i very badly needed the phone as my old phone had broken i have been using amazon services for more than 4 years now but never had this type of pathetic experience  and about phone the 4 stars i gave are only for phone i would give only 1 star for amazons packaging  i am in love with the phone its of the size i was looking for and has a smart screen it has many preinstalled apps i will not be needing some of these apps and had uninstalled them  internal memory could have been more though specifications say that it has 4 gb of internal memory user will only get 1 gb as remaining space is already used by phone os apps etc anyway it has extendable memory upto 32 gb and i hope to many of the apps to sd card  back cover seems very weak and so a protective back cover is a must addition
4822	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	1 amazonin delivery was on time  2 phone is really good for its price if you are looking for an android phone which is fast for basic telephone messaging skype etc this is a good choice  3 size is perfect  screen is not too small neither is the phone too big for your pocket  4 screen display is surprisingly clear and bright for this price  5 if you use the battery saving mode your phone could easily last more than a day without charging  6 had this phone for a few months and it has not hung even once
4823	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	i am nexus 4 user and bought this for someone who is less geeky nexus is a geeks phone where as i was looking for something cheaper and popular features xperia m fits the bill perfectly  xperia m definitely a good looking phone and looks more expensive than it is the screen is decent sized 4inch and is 245ppi which results in a sharp screen and vivid colors the viewing angles isnt the best of course but then its not a deal breaker  xperia m comes with jelly bean the latest android version and the phone is surprisingly quick a performance that i didnt expect at this price games are running without any pauses and the overall experience is delightful i havent run a movie on it yet but online hd videos worked fine too on the youtube app what makes the experience great is the sound level loud and a decent quality this has always been sonys forte the sound has always been great  i was asked to pick a phone which is best in up to 15k range and after my detailed research this phone is the best in this range an overall winner
4824	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	good phone overall camera sometimes hangs and some apps are not downloaded properly but xcelnt feel for touch and gud music a feel different from other android phones so u wont feel bored battery backup is decent without wifi and 3g on
4825	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	here comes amazon beware flipkart  i got this product at the cheapest price at amazon and mind it that too with amazon trust i fully recommend all of you if you are looking fro a mid range smart phone then surely go for this one i my self own a windows lumia 720 but i found this better than any things else in thsi category go for it fellas 
4826	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	hi guys   i have been using this phone for more than 18 yrs i bought this phone in the week wen it was launched its pretty good phone actually its outdated when it is launched it was the one of best phone in the range of 13kbut after so many months  new china brands overcome the specs of all branded mobile  pros decent display handy i like 434 phones good hw quality video recording is better in day time connectivity is good sony brand is the brand after iphone it is better than samsung sound quality is great support all the videosbut now 534 phones are good for movies and games  cons poor battery backup low ram and internal memory front camera is completely waste u cannot use in day time too phone heats up photo quality is pathetic camera but not responsive it will take atleat 20 secs to open camera afert u press a key button u can only use basic apps low internal memeory will make u feel bad wen ur frn using other china phones
4827	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	i had bought this phone in the month of january 2014 with lots of expectations and happiness unfortunately it stopped working after two months and i gave it to the sony service center for repair they replaced the pcb of my phone after two weeks waiting period once i received the phone i could notice that only sony headphones would work with it and none of my skull candy or sennheiser headphones would work whereas before repair all my headphones other than sony and sony itself used to work with my phone i complained about it to the service center and they behaved in a rude manner and rejected my complaint saying that i am supposed to use only sony headphones with it and nothing else i took the matter to the higher authorities at sony but no one followed up on my request this might be one in a hundred cases and i was unfortunate enough to be a victim of sonys negligence towards customers anyway i bought a samsung galaxy s3 in an exchange offer and is using it since april 2014 without any regrets i was deeply hurt as i lost rs 11500 for buying a sony junk and using it for just 3 months but i could at least recover some of that money via the samsung exchange offer now i dont buy any sony products and always keep away from that company
4828	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	the overall experience of buying this phone was completely underwhelming the packaging of the phone was very shabbily done and the outer box was in taters when it arrived inside the amazon brown box the phone was loosely kept without any bubble wrap of protective packing the packing was worse than what our local vegetable vendor sends his products in for the packing i give this 1 star thankfully the phone was not broken on arrival the phone also didnt work reliably for the past 1 week i had to travel to new delhi with it and there were many spots where the phone just wasnt able to receive calls or make calls this problem was not consistent but would happen at least 15 times a day when it would just stop receiving calls it was very hard to figure out the problem as there were times when it would still receive and make calls this problem stopped once i returned back to mumbai this was not a roaming problem as i was using the same sim card in my older nokia phone and it was able to make and receive calls just fine from those same locations for the performance of the phone in the first 2 weeks i give it 2 stars finally the design and aesthetics of the phone are better than any other phone ive come across so far so in the 34looks34 category i give the phone a 3 or 4 star  in summary i would be highly cautious in buying any expensive item from amazon again
4829	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	sony xperia m is the best mid level android phone you can buy in the market it have all the nice specs that you might expect in mid range hirange phones display is of good resolution and have good viewing angles  i have heard lot of negative reviews that viewing angle of this phone is very bad but comparing to other phones its not that bad  5mp camera is of average in nature hdr feature is good to experiment with video recording of 720p is also average but remember to activate image stabilazation  wifi and bluetooth easy to connect and its only take seconds to search and find networks  this phone can only hold micro sim which made me some problems initially i was using normal sim which have to cut into micro sim to use on this device  the one and only problem i notice with this phone is low internal memory with lot of crappy unwanted applications installed by sony available internal memory was way low to 13gb i uninstalled those unwanted applications but still 15 gb internal memory which is too low for this phone games like nfs most wanted and asphalt cant be installed due to low memory even i am using 16gb class 10 card no applications and games be installed on memory card i dont know its by sony or android jelly bean limitation but one thing i can say its really frustrating only option i have is to root phone but that eventually gonna void my warranty  call quality is good speakers are on bottom so if you place it over a surface some times you may not hear ringingif you have a low ringing volume noisy atmosphere and mild ringtone it happened to me many time  notification light is a good addon that you get with this phone you can customize the color of notifications as your choice assisted gps is also good but will take some time to lock on satellite  so overall money spend well and wisely
4830	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	as per the company price as given by amazon it was rs14000  and was sold for 11140 offering a handsome discount  but according to sonys price listing the phone costs only 11500 that is plain cheating and i dont have the benefit of warranty dr subhash chandran
4831	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	i have been using this phone for almost an year now this is one of the best phones in this price range  its not about having quad or octa core processor this phone has a dual core processor  but performs really smooth the primary camera is good the display is also pretty nice the battery lasts for more than two days with average usage overall good phone to buy in this price range ps dont update the firmware on this phone itll make the phone considerably slower my phones speakers and mike started misbehaving after the update the update will only change the version from 41 to 43 means youll be still having jellybean after updating
4832	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	sony xperia m is a nice model if you are looking for a mobile below 12k sony always assures the quality and clarity  just go for it 
4833	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	on time on quality packed full accessary with bill i would be more more happy for further  order to amazonin
4834	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	a much better phone as compared to other phones coming at this range the configuration is good and i dont think any one will have complain about it the camera quality is also good overall its a good buy
4835	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	light weight phone with excellent screen value for money phone in sub 10k range battery life seems good however have not used it extensively yet packaging and delivery was as always on time from amazon back cover of the phone seems not very strong chargers  wire quality could have been better its very hard  did not find sound tone setting options for commonly used apps such as sms  ring tone change option is available only for incoming phone rings 
4836	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	first of all packing was terrible and it was almost crushed i was worried before to open the package thinking it might be a damaged product i will think twice next time before purchasing on amazon  xperia m screen size said to be 434 but seems to be smaller that what it looks on the image screen width is small my current apple 4s 3534 screen looks bigger than xperia m 434  i am yet to use the phone and will post further reviews if any
4837	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	nice smartphone from sony 5mp camera is good but not excellent front cam is only 03mp its not goodbattary life is 1day if u use it otherwise 1 12 dayvideo quality is very good audio is alsobut earphones are not loud internet speed is fastit is the best phone for internet usersflash light is superblooking is just oknot badand totally satisfied phone in 10krecommended to those who can not spend money above 10k best mobile at all
4838	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	the phone works like a dream i gifted it to someone and made a right choice because it is a class choice at a reasonable price  sony products make a stylestatus statement as well i am happy that i did not buy the so called less expensive ones available in the market  this phone is an excellent machine if you are not after the latest model latest software and latest whatnot
4839	Sony Xperia M (Single SIM, Black)	a premium looking phone for the budget excellent design from sony comes with latest jelly bean os no hangs yet touch experience the best in category
4840	BQ S37 IPS&quot; Touch Phone with 4.4.2 KitKat OS	it looks as a good phone13 ghz processor512mb ramdual camera3gi but the shipping charges are bit highand considering the final selling price its better to go for indian firmsthat have standing service stationslike micromaxkarbonnspicemaxx than go for this considering as a new entrant in this smartphone sector this product should have been attractively pricesunder 3kwhich it isnow giving free shipping and some freebieslike screen guardcheaper bluetooth dongle etcwell thats my honest opinion

4842	BQ S37 IPS&quot; Touch Phone with 4.4.2 KitKat OS	i just tried a luck by buying this phone as it is damn cheap with all good configurations cant believe a phone below rs2800 has all the stuff in it its camera and video quality is good though it is not meant for professional photography youtube videos could be clearly seen as in hd tv with good volume as in television has fm radio it has good touch sensitivity better than my hisense good battery 1800 mah  gets 3g and wifi and bluetooth what else more good for internet browsing all the facilities and working fine like a smart phone of the range of rs6000 rs 7000 the size of the phone is also ok  neither too large nor too small android kitkat light weight  though the phone does not have the get up of a high priced smartphone but you can use a flip cover has only a ram of 512 mb but it is enough for me the memory is only 512 mb but can be expanded so it is not a problem has two camera  and dual sim what else needed
4843	BQ S37 IPS&quot; Touch Phone with 4.4.2 KitKat OS	my expectation is too high for this but this phone couldnt get my expectationits memorycameraflash every this is poor and whatever you show about this phone is totally wrong camera is 1 mp and ram  is 3712mb not 512 mb

4865	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	htc desire 616 is one of htcs more 34mainstream34 models  it is actually an experiment based on outsourced production the build quality is sturdy and without creaks even though the phones external materials are made of glossy plastic fingerprint magnet it is based on android 422 with a mostly stock android that has light touches of htc sense ui it is not a 34full34 htc sense device the octacore processor is very fast for day to day tasks  moreover the underclocked cpu 14ghz ensures the phone doesnt heat up too much the display is slightly disappointing it is a regular tft lcd display and not the better ipsamoled types and does not have any gorilla glassdragontrail protection however it produces a good image with subdued colours compared to the highly oversatured amoled display on my earlier phone in practice i found the display and viewing angles on par with micromax phones in this price range that also claim to have ips screens  multimedia wise the phone does well hd videos play smoothly enough and the audio quality for music falls into the 34good enough34 category however for music fans this phone is not a substitute for a sony or the better htc phones this phone does not come with beats audio for example found on higher end htc phones it also does not feature the front facing speaker or the special preamplifier circuits found on those higher end phones it is definitely good enough but it is obvious htc focused on the stock circuits for audio playback given by the chipset inside the phone music is balanced but lacks the 34punch34 that you would notice on an xperia or the higher end htcs its more like one of those tier2 chinesetaiwanese brands in this sense  acer alcatel gionee etc  voice calling is again in the 34good enough34 category voices are clear and noise is adequately suppressed however the voices are often not loud enough and sometimes the tones are muffled there are clear differences between the phones i have used and i can say that htc can do better than this the volume of the phones speaker is good enough but barely audible in outdoor environments in urban areas again 34good enough34  the camera is slightly disappointing but again takes 34good enough34 pics for the most part  this phone is what i would recommend if you want an 34htc lite34 experience blinkfeed is awesome in an otherwise average phone with a decent processor and gpu that runs most modern games and 3d applications well the build quality is definitely a step above the chineseindian phones in this price range but features wise you can certainly do better  all in all i do recommend it most of this review also applies to the htc desire 620g the main differences in that phone being a noticeably better camera and android kitkat 442 as opposed to 422 in this phone both phones will receive at least one major update in the next year or so so i wouldnt write them off
4866	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	the mobile looks very slim and good looking video quality is also fine compare to other similar products
4867	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	please read carefully its long but worth it   im a tech savvy student and was a huge fan of htc until a few months ago my first android was a htc wildfire it turned from a good to a terrible phone in 6 months i still loved htc i went ahead and bought its flagship phone the one x it had the best specs that time 64 gb internal memory beats audio 17 ghz quad core nvidia processor fastest that time i was impressed by the phone lag free didnt hang everything was perfect until one day when htc made a public statement that the one x wont get any updatesthe m7 was shortly launched before the announcement so here i was stuck on android 421 when even budget phones had kitkat i still have the phone today and regret it htc and nvidia played the blame game against each other and the end consumer suffered   never ever go for htc  all htc phones suffer from poor battery life after a few months  lack of software updates i spend a huge sum buying this phone and this is what i get software support for even less than a year stuck on old software   htc is a careless company never ever keeps its old phones updated even flagships   its an honest opinion folks never go for htc ever even the budget lumia series is better than  all htc phones 
4868	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	picture quality is not at all good from both front and back camerabattery drains a lotwhen charge is fullremaining time is 14hrs but as soon as wifi or data connection is onbattery gets discharged within 4hrseven this phone hangs a lot especially while typing messages and also using internet memory pack up is very goodlot of apps can be installedoverall okas it is htc so thats wat makes it trendy
4869	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	worth itnice camera qualityfront camera could hv been bttrspeaker sound is very lessbut earph quality n sound iz awsmeno lags while playing gamenice ph on diz price
4870	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	this is the phone that i wished a lotone of my friend purchased this phone for me around a few weeks agothis phone working fabulouslydont waste your time buying of samsung and other phonesthis phones camera is superb as compares with s3battery backup also fine main drawback is internal memorythats not a matter when we buy a 16 or 32 gb sdcardover all ill give  it 85 out of 10
4871	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	gud with android jelly bean  but didnt made my expectation it used to get hangevery time its not been 2 weeks but this phone is showing which is unexpected totally unhappy  while calling several application gets opened automatically
4872	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	audio profile is not at expected level like from others but it gives pleasant sound which is safe to the human ears so i think it is better to listen music at audible range  than high range
4873	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	the mobile is good in terms of speed and size it is very slim and the charging is also good but the only draw back is camerathe camera quality is not upto the mark when compared samsung nokia and other products 8mp pixcel camerathe sound quality is  also goodthe screen though they say its 5 inch screen the display for use is less than expectedif camera is good the  mobile would have been excellent  but still it is good
4874	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	really awesome mobile for the price i purchased for i bought it when it was under lightening deal as product this is definitely a best mobile to buy if your budget is around 15k
4875	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	i am completly disappoented with this devicebuying after 3 months the ear phone jack of the device charger ear phone had not been working then l contact to sevice centre  after submission the device earphone and charger it was returned one month later becoz only one sevice centre in kolkata
4876	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	i like this smartphone  having good performance as i expected in this price range picture quality is good  voice capturing feature is very enjoyable and dark gray color is surpb thank you htc  thank you amazon
4877	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	plz do not buy this mobile ive bought this mobile 1 year agoit isnt worthive been to service center 3times for nowthe audio chipset is worstive got the earphone jack problem twice the phone becomes very slow if u run multiple tasksi know everyphones lags a bitbut this particular thing is even slower and speaking of battery i wouldnt recommend it even for the users who moderately uses the phonesbcoz it drains like anything  when this phone came to marketits price was around 17kand whats the price now  this tells allit isnt worth i love htcbut this particular model and service center of htc made me unhappy
4878	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	it is just bad  every now and then it goes on a airplane mode  people suggested that you should lock the screen  i tried to talk on speaker mode  but nothing works  while you are communicating with someone it suddenly goes on airplane mode and then it will take you couple of minutes to change the settings and get connected with your network  when the issue was discussed with support they said that the third party apps loaded by you are creating problems  i have only two apps on my mobile viber and whatsapp  and if you are not going to use the apps on smartphone then why one needs a smart phone
4879	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	good service from amazon but bad product from htc i was using htc incredible s and was very happy till it died i used micromax camvas nitro and it was awesome but had littlet issue so returned it and bought htc 616 octa core nah not even near it freezing lag slow just out of box so returned it now have canvas gold wow what a phone htc learn from others how to make good phone at lower price
4880	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	the design features razzmatazz all good but unfortunately does not meet the basic purpose of using a phonewhich is 34to talk34  the phone automatically goes into the airplane mode even by disconnecting a running call every now and then imagine when this happens when you are in a meeting apparently happens as per some internet reviews when its screen brushes against your cheeks and the position of the airplane mode checkbox so not satisfied period
4881	HTC Desire 616 Dual sim (Pearl White)	i expected a lot from this mobilebut it is kind of average response i got from itthe amazon has done a good job in packaging and stuffjob well donecoming to the mobile it looks are classy compared to other mobiles in this segmenthere are the pros and cons of the mobile  pros 1good resolution 2good performance of the processor 3good looks 4light weight  cons 1very low sound 2average camera quality  i bought this mobile only because of the brand name of htcin this same specs huwai holly has been launched at comparatively cheaper price so it will be tough for htc and other branded companies to compete with these new companies only if people get to know what the mobiles of these new companies are likebut i will not recommend this mobile for any music fan or amateur photographers as it is not for thembut you will forget all these negative points and love the mobile purely on its display and performance

4947	Gionee Marathon M3 (White)	gionee marathon m3  5000mah  is the successor to the already popular gionee m2  4000mah  as the name suggests the most interesting feature of this phone is the huge battery it comes with  build quality good build quality overall with a matte finished back panel m3 is a bulky phone and is heavy thanks to the big battery inside the phone comes with a free flip cover in the box  display 5 hd display with good viewing angles  software this is powered by a mediatek mt6582 chipset and comes with 1gb of ram i would have loved seeing this powered by an octacore mt6592 instead like every other gionee phone in the market this too runs their custom ui  amigo ui on top of android kitkat this comes with a lot of software additions and tweaks offering better experience hotknot double tap to wake up etc are supported unfortunately since the ui is quite heavy comparing to stock android expect lags often  storage out of 8gb you get around 25 gb for apps you can choose sdcard as the default installtion location otg is supported  camera 8mp2mp overall quality of the rear camera is quite good front camera is a fixed focus one  battery the main reason for buying this device should be this huge 5000mah battery on board nonremovable it can go on and on the downside is the handset is bulky and quite heavy as of this writing no other phones ships with such a big battery  verdict buy this for batteryoverall performance of the custom ui on this is not that great since you can get octacore 2gb ram devices for the price this is shipping i would recommend getting those instead of this if battery backup is not your top priority

5007	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	when hunting for a new mobile phone being biased by flood of android based phones in market in beginning i was bit skeptical about windows os but its just a matter of a couple of days of hands on it i found it is better than my existing android phone no hangs no delays utter smooth operation  people said that there are few apps for windows i found that there are lot of options for normal users may be for app freaks they may be less for someone who is addicted to social media apps like facebook this is the best phone facebook is deeply integrated in the os  touch is near perfect performance is superb which i judged by playing asphalt 5 game on the device it runs as charm with full details on i liked the 34kids corner34 feature very useful when you have kids around build quality is very good form factor and screen size are optimum feels good to hold in hands offline maps feature is decent however you may not find it as informative as google maps  some features may be lacking like easy interface for enabling data networks wifi bluetooth and airplane mode but then there is widget for that it would be better if this widget comes preinstalled in the os  sound is quite good creating and managing playlists is a pain i am unable to figure out a clean way of doing it yet but once done that should not bother any user regularly  call quality voice clarity etc are very good  overall a very good phone in this price range of course quite a good bargain when bought from amazon as compared to other online stores as well as retailers
5008	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	amazon  delivered in time as mentioned  product original  packing was good  helpful interaction with amazon team   bought this handset for my dad at 6999 inr using it from 1 month   positives  light weight  easy to hold and goes well in your pockets  build quality excellent  ips display perfect under sunlight  sufficient features and applications available  battery life very good last 3 4 days  operating system smooth no lag  audio quality good  voice clarity good  camera apps and camera perfect in sunlight but decent performance under low light   the most beautiful feature i found is the kids corner here you can create different profile for your kid and you will be at peace while your child is trying her hands at your mobile with this profile your child can not make any outgoing calls or can not mend with your important files in the phone  restrictions  front  camera  flash  512 mb ram few high graphics games lags or not possible to play at present  so it is not disadvantages it is actually restriction of this handset   disadvantages   at 3g mode handset becomes hot and battery drains very fast   the headset bundled with box are not so good and dont have facility to answer the call from headset  there is no key to search within mobile instead there is a key that takes you to the web search engine bing  file manager missing
5009	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	i liked this phone kudos to amazon for delivering it on time good windows phone sturdy build and quality very smooth what i liked so much was the free office suite they have  word powerpoint and excel  for free  but no profiles for silent outdoor  good phone for office purposes
5010	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	the price for which ive bought this phone is less than rs6800 and trust me im loving keeping this phone as my secondary phone the touch response is awesome switching app is even smoother using a windows os is totally different than the android as im using nexus 4 and im loving using this new os in such a nice phone in this price  now coming on to the services of amazonin  i have always considered that flipkart has the best services may it be refunding process replacement process cancellation process or delivery time but this time amazonin has played its part after stepping into the world of competition in indian market trust me im amazed the way they have started their website by such low prices for almost every product their own courier facility is even better than flipkart that anyone can rely on it without keeping any followup i must say that other leading websites like flipkart and ebay must start thinking upon their new rival now as its gonna be the best in few time  i wish you guys all the very best kudos

5019	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	i am quite an old fashioned person when it comes to electronic gazettes i was never fascinated by smartphones tablets and other touch screen devices and was very happy with my simple basic mobile it was only accidentally that i gave it a thought to go for a smartphone after i lost my mobile and my technosavvy friend advised me to go for this  the transition from a simplest basic mobile to the smartphone could never be more easier thanks to nokia lumia 520 and windows 8  i do not know much technical bits to appraise this mobile but i can state many of its advantages from a laymans angle  1 excellent build quality i dropped it on a cement road from my bicycle to find it in three pieces but nothing was damaged 2 for its primary usage as a phone excellent voice quality speaker phone is at its best signal reception is also very good sms interface is very different than regular basic phones and i found it to be quite innovative 3 screen size of 4 is quite appropriate it fits in your palm well and goes in the packet very nicely 4 display quality is excellent it may not have the best viewing angle though but for a single viewer you get the best 5 windows 8 feels amazing very user friendly desktop kind of interface and positioning of apps could not be more simple 6 it will not be wise to ignore windows phones thinking that it does not have enough apps you would find apps for almost all of your needs 7 the most beautiful feature i found is the kids corner here you can create different profile for your kid and you will be at peace while your child is trying her hands at your mobile with this profile your child can not make any outgoing calls or can not mend with your important files in the phone  though there are some limitations as below  1 there is no front camera but what more can you expect in a budget phone 2 no radio but for me it doesnt matter i do have best radio apps downloaded in my phone 3 there is no key to search within mobile instead there is a key that takes you to the web search engine bing i cant justify a separate key only to search over web 4 lack of dual sim dont understand why nokia does not have this  overall i found this to be the best smartphone with a budget below 10k go for it even if your budget is more than it it is worth for each and every paisa

5022	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	there are other reviews that talk about the amazing features of this smart phone so i wont touch upon that to be brief its an amazing quality smart phone at the price it is and you wont be disappointed by the operating systemappstouch screen etc  the only thing that is totally disappointing is the battery life i have been using this phone for about 5 months now and here are the statistics  1 without wifi  3g data enabled  about 1718 hours 2 with only wifi no 2g3g data usage  about 15 hours 3 both wifi and data on all the time with few whatsappfacebook usage  down to about 13 hours  i must say nokia has got it totally wrong and screwed up its own usp which was the battery life in all its earlier phones there are battery saver options etc but dont help much  given this i would leave it to a buyers choice on what he wants certainly its a good trade off if you ignore the battery life but once you have overcome the fascinations of using a smart phone battery life will really take precedence
5023	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	writing review after 9 months of use tried thiswindows phone after using android moto defy nokia lumia 520 was one of the best option in its price range before launch of moto e overall phone is really good from build quality kind of obviously  its a nokia and performance wise as well it was satisfactory no lags of any sort the only main comparison would be of windows vs android after switching to windows phone i felt really good for the first few months but later i started feeling that i am missing a lot i really felt access to information news entertainment other informations etc is more open in android by way of apps and notifications from a user perspective i really felt structure of windows ui restricts reaching to things smart phone has to have very user friendly interface from os and apps perspective i felt that was missing in windows completely anyway this definitely going to remain as my backup device as i am shifting back to android now thinking of buying lg g pro 2
5024	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	when i searched for a smartphone i looked for 1 stunning display with good viewing angle 2 smooth touch 3 good af camera 4 simple ui 5 office suit 6 long operation without heating up lumia 520 has all the features i looked for and it comes under my budget below 8k lumia 520 is good for stunning display ultra smooth touch no lag luxury design af camera windows os nokia brand value  its bad for no stop button in music player but u can pause it cant remove sd card without removing battery no galleryfile manager camera quality is not good in low light condition no preinstalled apps games video audio wallpaper no profile management difficult call history management no call duration summary no distinction between incomingoutgoingmissed calls to set a song as ring tone u need an app to change ur device name u need a computer single volume control for all types of sound ring tone alarm tone music player alerts cant zoom or pause while recording video cant delete multiple messages from a thread in one go without internet it is nothing
5025	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	to tell the truth i wasnt too excited when nokia launched its lumia series with samsung htc and apple leading the smartphone wars nokia was left miles back surprising enough nokia struck back with its most impressive line of mobile phones till date joining forces with microsoft was a very smart move for nokia instead of developing its own os it went for windows 8 and left all the marketing of os to microsoft  when i heard the price of lumia 510 precursor to lumia 520 i was taken aback 10k for windows 75 phone still i waited for an update to windows 8 thats when lumia 520 was launched but for some reason or the other i couldnt buy it then one day i saw the price 6999 and bought it immediately online dont regret it one bit the best smartphone i ever had  pros  1 build quality superb on par with higher line of lumia series matt finish is just wonderful 2 screen size prefect for me at 4 inches this beauty is no doubt an amazing buy 3 display while it does not have clear text technology of lumia 620 its nevertheless every bit its worth only downside  is reading in sunshine is not as clear as lumia 620 4 interface truly elegantif you think androidios is elegantuser friendlygive this beauty a try youll be astounded 5 apps all essential apps available though apps are not in the counts of android marketplace or app store you wont be disappointed as all essential apps we use daily are available 6 office 365 full ms office suit though many may not use this i use ms word quite regularly 7 colors amazing bright colors could easily give samsung a run for its money that only launches mobiles in black and white  cons 1 front camera not a deal breaker though at 7k or even 10k i expect nothing more 2 radio not a deal breaker i usually use tune in internet radio 3 flash no led flash now this was disappointing they could have added it 4 ram 512 mb ram even though processor is 1ghz and windows 8 demand less ram 1 gb could have added more value to the product still no deal breaker at this price   in 10k range this baby easily outsmarts every other smartphone give this beauty a try and you wont be disappointed easily one of the best buys i made this year
5026	Nokia Lumia 520 (Black)	i will never any electronic good from you the cell phone i gotvwas rusted from within and it stopped working i went to a local nokia repair center but they said that there is no warranty on online purchases i had to buy a new cell phone horrible experience i am going to post this in all consumer forums  and make sure that people dont fall prey to this again

5035	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	i can see people complaining of lag  hangs  poor viewing angles for this device trust me guys i am using this device  i havent found any of these issues yet  i guess those who found such issues are unfortunate enough to have found a faulty piece complain to the sellers guys not sony   coming back to the phone 1  it packs a punch with lots of pre loaded apps which if you find boring can easily uninstall  free up your space  2  rear camera is good enough but i found a bit of a noise  distortion in clarity in some of the night clicks the inadequate lighting conditions might be the reason for this but yeah it wouldnt have made sony go at a loss had they provided a 12mp front camera though i am not much of a skype person for video calls  stuffs  more of a whatsapp  hike guy i guess atleast sony should have gone for a 12 mp front camera i mean cmon guys we are not living in the nokia 6600 age when vga camera was in the market  3 the 720p picture  video quality is really an icing on the cake stream as many videos you wanna from youtube you will never be bored or frustrated for resolution  picture quality  4  with 2370mah battery sony has launched this monster with a bang nokia is the undisputed champion in terms of battery but if sony keeps on launching phones with this much juice in it the finnish giant aka nokia will be getting some sleepless nights i guess the only con i guess is the high charging time in this aspect even after the updates both android  firmware updates the charging time is still 45 hrs which is a bit frustrating still with the 1 day back up that too after constant calls streaming chats  playing my favourite clash of clans the battery was left with enough juice till midnight so that i can sleep away while the phone is in charging  5  when it comes to music sound quality both distortion  noise free it was it is  it always will be sony hands down with a few enhancing modes available for your twerking sony has left no holds barred to provide a cell in the mid level with excellent sound quality both for voice calls  music the only con in this aspect is the made in jhumrutallaiya kind of pathetic headset  6  the best part though the illuminating neon band at the bottom of the cell it gives you kind of a bling feeling guys
5036	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	goods visual appearance is so good not so much weight easy and handy in use features are good  screen colors are not so saturated looked a bit white camera average processor  after updating the android  speed is a bit slow
5037	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	the worst mobile phone ever encountered by me i strictly advice not to buy one excessive heating problems and simultaneously super quick battery drainage right from the very first week the phone is just 4 months old for example 100 to 60 battery drainage in just 45 minutes the phone heats up suddenly also the sony support and service centres are the worst ever possible and couldnt carve out the problem eveven though circuit board and battery was changed also this phone has oodles of hanging and lagging problems i have been using smartphones right from the time of nokia n70 n90 times and use the latest of phones as and when required but this phone is my biggest buying regret ever
5038	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	pros  its perfomance and battery life are great never lagged once when using  the light bar at the bottom looks good on the phone  voice clarity and music playback are awesome  battery life is two days long with wifi continously on games constant messaging browsing etc  android 43 coming soon cons  display looks a bit washed out  touch screen stops responding while chargingfound in many xperia sp devices  very bad cover given along with this model it got torn in just over a month  the latest firmware update contains some minute bugs
5039	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	looking is simply superb n about the performanceeven though it is updated with jellybeanmobile is hanging without sdhc n its upto you to use sdhc or not so user have to run ccleaner multiple times in a day n about charging only 3040 hoursfinally not at satisfied with this product
5040	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	i bought this phone a month ago after reading its reviews for months  compairing it to numerous others in rs 15k range but after using it i realised that all the good it had is only on paperi mean to say that i am really very disappointed with the performance of this phone and it got worse after the 43 update some of the major poor aspects are 1 camera quality never seen such poor quality images of a 8 mp of any brand 2 hanging it hangs every now  then and the worse thing is that u cannot do anything to it as the battery is not removable 3 android 43 uupdate really horrible after update finally i am cursing myself for buying it
5041	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	best finish very gorgeous looking smartphone the led bar at phone bottom is chic and an eye catcher great phone lightly on the expensive sidewould have been mind blowing if it came in quad core
5042	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	i bought this phone last year around august 2015 i have been using it from then bought the phone of flipkart i put a 32gb sdcard in it  about the phone  performance is good it has not given me any troubles till now battery lasts for more than 2 days is used only in 2g  draw backs  1 camera could have been better  2 sony officially announced that there will be no kitkat upgrade for this model it was a heart break for me  when i bought the phone it was priced at 22k i got the phone for about 20k with some cashback offers
5043	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	pros 1 the price is too good 2 music player is awesome 3 size is perfect ie neither too big nor too small 4 nice neon color effects 5 sound quality is top notch  cons 1 interface is a bit glitchy at times 2 battery life and camera quality are average 3 viber runs like s 4 not enough options when it comes to customizing themes or the colored lights 5 no kitkat update available as of now  overall the perfect smartphone for those who just want to satisfy their basic needs without spending too much
5044	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	very much disappointed with in two weeks battery back up is very poor while sleeping i kept the phone fully charged in the morning the battery percentage was 69 without doing anything i have to charge three or four times a day if receive long calls or use internet i am not satisfied with the camera too camera is not having that much quality which sony usually delivers
5045	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	1excellent design 2display is stunning 3smooth performance 4transparent strip simply awesome 5sound quality is good 6videos are playing very smooth without any lag badcamera not good in low light conditions
5046	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	little bulky overpriced for its claimed feature and very weak back plastic cover except these 3 i liked the phone overall reception picture camera sound and look  feel is quite impressively embedded into the phone and turned out a very good present
5047	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	the battery backup is really good never get hanged while playing online games also the touch pad is not up to the mark
5048	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	excellent specs better than last year flagship phone galaxy s3  you can play high end games with this phone because of its high adreno the best phone probably you can get without selling out an exorbitant amount of money  excellent battery fast processor high quality browsing the best of a smartphone from sony indeed
5049	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	no ear phone given the product after contacting many times to replace the ear phone but no response from the amazonin
5050	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	i not received free case cover which is mention over box no other issue with this order rest all ok
5051	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	phone is ok but dont buy it it is totally outdated and sony is not giving any software updates
5052	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	looking for better camera dont choose xperia sp poor camera performance by sony
5053	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	best phone  but only issue is with the camera clarity it gives blurr image 
5054	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (Black)	after 1month use i had got touch problems and stamp also not found on bill
5055	Nokia X (Dual SIM, Red)	bad phone as i not expected from nokia before it i have nokia 5233 symbian phone and it is super fine quality in camera option
5056	Nokia X (Dual SIM, Red)	i didnt liked to give any star to this useless product because   1 i received it at rs 8300 but now it is available at about rs 5000  2 the headphone that i received got damaged in four months i took it to the care and they refused to accept saying i myself did that  3 it gets slow very often  4 do not support google play and nokia store is worst  5 do not support google maps  6 camera quality is also not fine and it lacks the option to set timer to click photo  7 it lacks voice recorder which is very common in almost all mobiles  8 the way of receiving call is not good the call gets received without knowing if kept in pockets   thus can be said that this product was a waste of money to me and would also be a waste of money to you and can be said the whole nokia team is useless
5057	Nokia X (Dual SIM, Red)	nokia xas you may have already heard is the first android device from nokia many android fans have been waiting for an android device from nokia for yearsand now they finally have it unfortunately nokia has decided to bring out a low end budget phone instead of a phone with high end specs and all   screen and build quality at first looknokia x looks like just another lumia devicethe build quality and design is almost same as their popular lumia devices poly carbonate all around with colored interchangeable back panel gives it an attractive look the device is easy to holdand the size is perfect for one handed operation on the front there is a 4 inch ips lcd 800 x 480 pixels wvga resolution display which is usually seen in devices under rs 5000 they should have at least packed a qhd display for a better viewing experience the viewing angles are oknot great readability under direct sunlight is poor   operating system and performance nokia x is powered by a 1ghz qualcomm snapdragon s4 play dualcore cpu and adreno 203 gpu it only has 512mb ram the specs are disappointing considering the various android devices at this price range ships with far better processor and gpuplus 1 gb of ram  antutu benchmark score  7400  similarly priced xolo q700s micromax a114 canvas mini 200 etc score around 17000   nokia has opted for a modified android version  based on 412 jellybean  instead of a smoother stock android experience most of the part the ui is smoothbut you will find lags here and there during application usageoften due to a low end processor and 512mb ram it has even though this runs android nokia has modified it so much so that it would be difficult to see any traits of android ui style in there it has a lumia like homescreen and there is only one button to navigate  a back button there is no multitasking button to switch between apps which is very disappointing   software nokia has opted not to include google apps instead are promoting those apps they favor so the popular core apps of android like android playstore gmailgoogle maps google etc are missing there are microsoft apps and nokias own popular apps like nokia here maps included whatever alternatives they providewithout the google playstoreyou are missing a lot of vast variety of apps however you can install amazon appstore and install many apps through it   camera disappointing the 3mp camera on the back is a fixed focus camera without auto focus capabilitiesits hard to get good pics often   battery this ships with only a 1500mah powered onewhich is not great you would hardly be able to get one whole day of battery backup with this average use with internet on    verdict  if you are already an android userthen its better to stay away from this android deviceas the ui is completely different and confusing for a new user or someone coming from a windows phone the experience would be much better the lack of google playstore is a major disadvantage with this deviceas the included nokia appstore doesnt have many popular android apps buy this only if you wanna try out a different new android ui my recommendation is to spend a few more bucks extra and get a better performing android device powered by quadcore cpu and 1gb of ram

5073	Nokia X (Dual SIM, Red)	i ordered this phone on april 12th 2014 at around 10 pm for my mother and it was delivered in a nice sturdy package on april 13th 2014 at 12 noon firstly what id like to highlight is the utter superiority of the phone when compared to others in the same price range especially the android phones as you may have seen android requires a lot of hardware and due to this low budget android phones costing below rs 10000 frequently hang and have a very bad user experience its been more than 15 days using this phone and my mother has not complained about any of these although this may also be a result of the extensive customizations that nokia  microsoft has done to this particular flavor of android a welcome experience though has been fastlane which shows you everything you need in one place call quality is good and the dual sim feature is an added plus considering that dual sim phones of competitors cost a lot more and as usual the touch sensitivity is quite good as well lastly please bear in mind that since this is not 34official google android34 you wont have access to the google play store but it is possible to use a concept of side loading to install apps from google play into this phone search for this on youtube overall a great decision to buy the phone
5074	Nokia X (Dual SIM, Red)	the nokias entry into the android scenario is definitlely assuring but has to go a long way on the fronts of usability and convenience the phone build is plastic and the screen clarity is just ok no lags or glitches but the absense of dedicated google apps could be a turnoff the calendar fuction and sync could be better have been using it for one month no serious issues till now

5132	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	just imagine you are buying a phone worth 12 lac rupees and you get a box which has seal already broken what will you think many questions can be raised is the mobile refurbished is there any problem in the mobile is the battery genuine is the mobile returned by some other buyer  and lot many questions so my suggestion is do not buy an expensive product onlinealways walk down to a shop where you can get a sealed pack box and piece of mind dont mind if you have to pay extra bucks  you can see video search for note 3 purchased from amazonin seller electronyx bazaar on youtube  which i had recorded while opening the courier sent by this seller you can clearly see the seller has very cleverly stuck the seal on top of an already open box seller claims that the seal might have broken in transit but not sure how can the seal remain intact from outside and not inside its genuine cheatingwhen i contacted the seller he says that if the mobile is defective i can get it repaired from samsung service just imagine a thought of taking your 1 day new mobile to service centre just because you have purchased a seal broken mobile online other option amazon and seller gave me is to return back the mobile good idea but seller gave me a heart break saying i will be responsible if anything goes wrong while transit so i inquired about transit insurance most of the courier companies were not ready to ship such an expensive mobile one who agreed said they will charge rs 900 for insurance and 400 for shipping and this amount has be to paid by me and not the seller a wise person will suggest me to keep the mobile in whatever condition it is because if something goes wrong in shipping i will loose the money and the mobile aswell so my suggestion to buyers is buy items costing few 1000s online but not such and expensive item
5133	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	the product which i recieved is a duplicate one
5134	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	note 3 is for sure priced at the high end so some may say samsung is overpricing this device like apple does with theirslets analyse  1 stunning display  super amoled 1080 x 1920 pixels 57 inches 386ppi with corning gorilla glass 3 protection 2 quadcore 19 ghz cortexa15  quadcore 13 ghz cortexa7  yes this has 2 processors inside onepowerful 19ghz cortex15 cores are used for high end tasksand 13 ghz battery efficient cortexa7 cores are in use when in idle and having to power up only simple tasks and apps 3 3 gb of ram 4 stylus support spen  with great stylus software additions built in there is no other android device having such a usable stylus software features 5 android 44 kitkat upgradable  update is available in india 6 great camera  one of the best you can get in an android phone 7 plethora of sensors  accelerometer gyro proximity compass barometer temperature humidity gesture 8 a lot of software additions helping to do things with various gestures 9 huge 3200mah battery 10 32gb internal memory  microsd card upto 64gb slot 11 multiwindow features  this is built for great multitasking as you can open multiple apps in split screen for multitasking  one thing i dont like about this device is the design this looks like any other samsung productapart from the fact that the back cover now has leather finish other manufacturers like sonyhtc etc are pushing out quality metalglass constructed well designed deviceswhy cant samsung do the sameat least on such a premium device   overall a great premium devicecoming at a premium prizeyou are getting what you are paying foryou are paying more for the software features it comes withelse it could have been priced around rs 30000  this is for sure one of the best android device in the market right nowbut if you are not interested in all these software gimmicks note 3 comes withor you dont like samsungs touchwiz interfacethen i strongly recommend getting a nexus 5 instead of thiswith nexus 5you are gonna get faster software updates too
5135	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	i got this for my dad he is enjoying with his note 3
5136	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	with a spate of manufacturers launching highend devices the focus has fallen on the pricing policy followed by them while part of it could be attributed to the rupees weak health but what really justifies buying a phone worth rs 50000  with most highend devices costing north of the 40k mark does it really make sense to invest such hefty amount on just a phone  now heres an evidence that these companies only want to loot your money to hell with your experience with the device absolutely shocking to see the double standards of samsung towards indians a snapdragon 800 chipset for the western world and a totally different exynos offering to maximize profits in the indian markets well its a cry shame samsung you disgust us  note 3 by no means is an offering really worth investing the 50k for a few enhancements and a faux leather back  i wouldnt be buying a phone costing more than rs30000 now and neither should you if you8217d really like to get a fancy device wait for a couple of months for the inevitable price drop investing such a significant chunk of money on a device that might be called outdated within a couple of months is just not worth it
5137	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	syed hey this version does not have a qualcomms snapdragon 800 quadcore processor it has a samsung exynos processor and its battery is a 3200 mah battery
5138	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	the phone is good genuine as far as device is concern but the back cover of delivered phone was of plastic not the leather one which spoils the look of phone the back cover is made up of leather finished plastic material which is not satisfying compare to  amazons previous purchases i request amazon people please look into issue asap
5139	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	its heating up badly dont go for it go for samsung s5
5140	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	i bought this really amazing device a few days ago from a brick and mortar store not onlinethe  only thing that i have to say for note 3 is that it is amazing and absolutely worth the moneyi am very happy with my new phone
5141	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	good productswift and slim
5142	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	very expensive but not at all worth 1000 rupees mobile
5143	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	very nice deal at very nice price amazon is very good online shopping portal i always shop here when i require any thing
5144	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	price is too high for a phone like this samsung is on marketing ad run spree and is expecting consumer to pay double the actual amount for their phones 2nd  the quality of phone equipment is cheaper than sibling of same of model in the usa or uk i am sure samsung is trying to leverage dumping policy for india which is yet not in full force if they do the same in the usa within 3 days they will be asked to recall all the devices  i will strongly recommend not to buy this phone just because it costs high to be realistic similar configuration phones are available for quite less amount lastly if you think brand matters then check online the reviews of after service offered by samsung  wait for a couple of months price of it will drop sharply apple has filed a case to stop samsung from selling phones in the usa thus samsung will be left with no choice but to focus on markets like india to survive they will have to compete on pricing front not with the attitude lets fool by keeping higher price and showcasing ourselves as premium phone
5145	Samsung Galaxy Note 3 SM-N9000 (Classic White)	please dont buy any samsung smartphone series  i faced lots of problem while using samsung galaxy grand 19082gt automatically restart hanged all applications wont work properly i filed complaints in perherdar all indian consumer courts i mailed to all shopping carts sites  if you want peace of mind then you have to not buying any samsung smart phone series  thanks  regards  mehul fozdar

5161	Sony Xperia Z2 (Purple)	when sony xperia z1 released i was one of the first customers to buy the handset from flipkart with lot of excitementbut trust me i am experiencing pathetic customer service from the customer care and service center department  sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products but in my case i failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like xperia z18230  1 on 24th december when i woke up in the morning i saw my xperia z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet there was no damage on the external glass but however the display had cracked from inside a single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked8230  2 in my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18000 rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on its own from inside there is no sign of external damage on the screen  3 sony customer care executives and sony service center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances they are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status i had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the sony service center i know few acquaintances who had similar experience with service center bhubaneswar  4 my handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me i requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked if i can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why cant the technicians employed by sony do the same  arent they qualified enough  5 while i handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when i received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly i have the photographs available with me  6 i had heard that sony xperia z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me  7 after sending an email to sony senior management in india sony head office support team sent an email stating i have to pay 50 of mrp for refurbished handset without accessories and 80 of mrp rs 28500 for fresh handset without accessories8230 prices offered by local sony service center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price8230 whatever happens to your handset sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k 30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment8230  it8217s really frustrating as sony customer service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty designbad quality equipment being used  trust me guys the service being offered by samsung for galaxy s4 which is a comparable model with z1 is much better than sony8230 sony is having the worst after sales service8230 i would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free82308230
5162	Sony Xperia Z2 (Purple)	the product never reached me i have complained to amazon nothing happened now i have been asked to rate this product and my experience how painful this can be

5173	Sony Xperia Z2 (Purple)	i was using a xperia z with this phone its like using a better version of it everything is better the battery the processor media clarity sound everything i love the slomo videos the silky smooth gaming experience and the awesomely long lasting battery just make sure you buy a good case and a nice screen guard to go along with it not that its delicate you will only be aiding the phone in serving you for a longer time i learn this the hard way with my xperia z when you are ready to spend so much for the phone might as well spend a little more in protecting it  something that you should know before buying this phone i feel this to be quite a dampner dont know why sony designed something like this the charging port and the sim card slot are next to each other this is not the problem the real problem is that they are both covered with the same flap that means every time you want to charge your phone or connect it through usb you will end up exposing the sim card as well this is not causing any trouble with the phones functionality just that as a user i feel this is a bad design  it came in with kitkat after spending about 2gb of internet data i now have lollipop 502

5182	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	decent looks functions value for money its been around 2 months since i am using it  volumes were low i tweaked it in engineering mode now its fine  very good battery backup network reception average camera good touch  nice to hold in hand looks premium like all xolo phones  only worried about xolo service if it is required  xolo has yet to provide kitkat update as announced  overall good
5183	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	as such i havent faced any problem to date including those mentioned in several other reviews probably the best in its price range i havent tried any of the games which require substantial hardware ratings but in everything else there is no lag whatsoever also to mention that the delivery was well within time packaging was good kudos to the product and the seller
5184	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	it in the worst mobile phonexolo q700s i have ever used in my life because of 1 low battery backup 2 poor quality of motherboard it got burn within only 11 days after buying 3 dust collection problem in main cameravery frequentlythis problem can never ever resolved 4 poor service by service center especially lucknow 5 a small issue takes atleast 45 days to resole itall mobile goes its main branch noida for resolution of a small problem 6 backside heating problem  so never ever buy any product of xolo its very painful 
5185	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	  quadrant standard 8211 6998   antutu 8211 17114 2nd time 8211 17534   vellamo 8211 html5 1954 metal 549   nenamark 2 8211 544 fps   multi touch  5 points  the q700s can play full hd videos  8mp rear camera quality is pretty impressive considering the price specially the closeups and long shots   it is in black and silver color combination
5186	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	have been an ardent fan of xolo from the time the company has launched  and i had brought the flagship phone on the day of its launch the xolo q800 in the previous year march 2013 now recently from the past 2 months i have been facing issues with 4 phones which i had brought for my company that is a q700i  q800 and 2phones q3000 model firstly q700i in this phone the issue stands is that the phone is having a heating up problem  the charger also gets highly heated up the speaker is having a distorted noise problem  secondly q3000 in this model the charger stopped working in its 3rd month itself when i have approached the service center they are worst bunch of service center people i have experienced in my life they in no sense know the meaning of the term 34service34 they have made me feel that customer is a slave if you have brought this companys products i gave my q3000 model charger to the service center people they have given me a q1010i charger after 10days of my continues followupwhen i denied to accept it they said to trust them and they will give me my model charger in more 1015days now they are saying that submit the q1010i charger also and they will give me a charger of q3000 after more 15days as they cannot get my original charger from the company and if i leave this charger also with them then only they will give me that charger after 15 days they will talk to the customer in the most abusive manner a person can and have asked me to whatever i can  in q700i i have given the phone to them for the repairing of the problem but they have taken the phone and will be giving after repairing after 2months only how can a person using a smartphone in the company work without the phone for 2months the phone was given to the person for its functionalities of using emails camera  google drive company erp software location tracking watsappetc the company should be providing a standby handset if the services cannot be met within 23days maximum or a replacement should be provided in the case of the handset being a factory manufacturing defect
5187	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	good price with good config to fit your budget camera clarity with display is also good ringtone sound is a bit low
5188	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	in the budget of 75k this phone is really value for money product camera quality is good it gives clear pictures in day and night even in low light all the apps are working well as expected phone design is attractive and handy battery little heatup while charging and playing games however overall features are good
5189	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	i got this phone today after 2 days from amazonthe delivery was superb and my seller was paragon limitedhe is fantastic seller in term of delivery this phone is beast believe memany complain about low sound but its not that too lowbattery takes time to chargefor me i am contend
5190	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	overall this is an average phone talking about the likes very spec with fast processor and a 1gb ram at this price also the camera is really good at day lighting now coming to the dislike the basic reason why we all buy a phone is for calling purpose both mic and speaker is a very bad quality even on silent room i have to shout so that the other person on call has to hear me which is very annoying coming to sound effect on a sennheiser head phone this is again annoying very bad quality camera at night and low lighting it just a dark you will see heat produced is very very very high esp while on call and charging  end of the day i wont recomend this phone if you use this for freq calling dont ever buy
5191	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	the phone is really good in terms of performance looks and build quality but i received a faulty product with a faulty battery so i had to opt for a full refund and i am happy that i got the cheque from amazon im only disappointed because they sent me a faulty product otherwise the phone or really good at this price range
5192	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	so after 15 days of use now its time for the review for 8k u wont get any better phone than this it has mali 400mp2  can play any high end gameits better than mali 400mp adreno 302  adreno 305 8mp camera its quite good but it seems like 5 mp dont think twice  b4 buying this bcauz  unlike mmx and karbonn xolo provides updated for its phones  this phone got kk update slimmer than other phones resolution is low 854 vs 400 as compared to other phones but its not a major issue
5193	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	i faced only 2 problems    heating problem   low sound other wise the phone is simply amazing before buying i was bit confused for the resolution but it has a very crisp display and very good viewing angles i have been using for past 8 months and the phone has never hanged i just love it the design is also very nice after this i have bought another 3 xolo phones and all of them are working nice the product of xolo are really awesome
5194	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	this phone is bang for bucks fast  smooth and good batterygood for gamers who want a decent phone under 10k  update your phone to kitkat to resolve some issues like heatingrest is good go for it not a single issue till date
5195	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	this is  the 4th xolo phone im purchasing and happy with every one of them this one is perfect for those who need a smaller screen with all the bells and whistlesincluding a 8mp camera battery lasts one day
5196	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	performance wise its a good phonei have tried all possible games on it and all of them were running smoothly but the sound of this device is very low but u can increase it by opening android setting
5197	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	this is superb budget mobile under 10000 rs i love amazon from now i m ur big fan because of service of amazoncoms
5198	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	this is good configuration in this price but everything is not working as stated 1 camera   very poor    410 2 processor  good  but get heated  910 3 screen resolution  enough  810 4 battery   not good enough need of 2400mah  lasts in 6 hours  610 5 ram  good  910 7 touch  i cot defective piece so have to replace  810 9 audio  poor  110 10 overall look and form factor  slim and weight full  610
5199	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	as always amazon delivered it before the given time xolo q700s is a good and satisfying product with 8 mp camera but the back button is a bit not to responsive as in other phones i personally recommend others to go with this product over all its a value for money thanks amazonin
5200	Xolo Q700s (Silver)	amazing phone i use this phone from last month this is very fast phone but battery is not very good other phone is awesome
5201	BQ S39 White	screen clarity is good but pixel is not good response of the phone is good 2g and wifi speed is good ui  touch is good mobile design is good accelerometer proximity are working fine light sensor and touch button lights are also working fine no lags with the mobile battery back up is not good not bad it may be 1000 mah cameras are not 5mp and 2mp as described in amazonin those are 4mp and 1mp and not showing all colors cameras are bad  it was restarting automatically 2 or 3 times in a day  so this is why i thought to give 2 starts for this product
5202	BQ S39 White	dont buy thisdont even think memory is less than 2 gbsystem apps are not installed that give you less than 1 gb
5203	BQ S39 White	charger not working pl resend another one also send price list for 32 gb sd card

5208	Samsung Galaxy Alpha SM-G850Y (Dazzling White)	very smart looking phone but its not worth the price its with 4g but battery is just 1860 it should be at least 2200 you should wait for 6 months and then buy as you will get it for half the price

5218	Nokia Lumia 610 (Black)	i have used it more than a year and a half and it was probably the worst phone taht i ever used i will feel so pathetic after using this one this one should have been in the price range of 30004500 not more than that worst camera no bluetooth support  no windows 8 support bcoz of 256 ram the network issue is quite high overall i would give it 29 out of 10 i used nokia 6070n then 3110c and after that n79 but believe me it was the worst of them all
5219	Nokia Lumia 610 (Black)	applications not good verry bad videos not dowload verry bad bad bad bad bad bad bad very very bad 
5220	Nokia Lumia 610 (Black)	perfect phone that too when one gets in 6499 thanks to amazon since i switched from android to lumia so im facing little bit problems thus i can say that windows phone is complicated but its worth buying satisfied
5221	Nokia Lumia 610 (Black)	i didnt like interface and battery backup
5222	Nokia Lumia 610 (Black)	using from dec 2012 work very well
5223	Nokia Lumia 610 (Black)	great performance so far after 45 months use has everything you need for anything more you should spend more great looks durable and great performance loved it
5224	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	this is my second windows phone after lumia 800 and my 20th phone after nexus 5 which had a pretty good android os but let down by poor battery life and horrible camera i wanted a phone not so big and with plenty of battery life great camera call quality offline maps well integration of social network and yes good gaming experience some of these i missed on ios and the battery thirsty android so just gave a shot at lumia 830 even thou i was familiar with the os with my past experience with lumia 800 2yrs back advantages 1 10mp pureview ois camera way excellent than 8mp competitors 2 durable and slim design aluminium frame with no coverage issues see images 3 expandable 128gb slot excluding the 16gb inbuilt  nexus 54s 16gb is limited to 1228gb 4 5 clear black ips 720p display with oleophobic coating is easy to clean now gorilla 3 addition is great 5 great 2200mah battery with over 12hrs hardcore use and 25hrs light use nexus4s5s5 all died within 8hrs limit 6 good 12ghz quad core snapd 400 chip with adreno 305 gpu and adequate 1gb ram 810 gaming experience 7 lte support cat 4 speeds 8 nfc wireless charging and bluetooth 40  disadvantages 1 for the premium price paid you can get a 1080p display phone 2 snapdragon 400 is somewhat pricey for a phone for 25k snapdragon 800s are available for this price 3 nano sim slot placed between the battery waist no hot swap here see images  i am aware it is a flagship device and the last phone to bear the iconic nokia badge but the premium price for a phone with midrange chip is somewhat pricey the same chip is found on lumia 730 with a better amoled display with slightly better display ppi but missing premium option like even a camera key nexus 5 lg g2 and z1 compact are other options with a higher 22ghz snapdragon 800 chip but not as good as lumia 830 when it comes to the ratio between the enormous battery and snappy snapdragon 400 processor my previous phone was a nexus 5 which had a pretty good performance and eye popping screen with 445 ppi but these plus points turned out to have a disappointing battery and camera quality awful quality my sisters lumia 720 had an even better 67mp camera snapdragon 400 maybe too pricey for a 25k device but windows phone 81 doesnt need hifi specs to run the os windows 78 even ran fine on single core 800ghz with 256mb ram device namely lumia 510 but here you gt a quadcore chip thou underclocked at 12ghz with adreno 305 gpu and a 1gb ram adequate to even fiddle while editing hd videos using movie creator app games like modern combat 4 and 5 never hung up crashed or heated up my device there is zero heating issue or hangups on my device the 2200mah battery is spectacular the micro sd slot is swapable ending my review finally talking about the built quality its 1010 perfect rigid and yes nokia standards the design resembles iphone similar network band gaps and yes the 930 itself the rear camera and led are encircled by glass made material with is good even the buttons are metal made i just hope the metal frame doest dent or fade off like on 55s hope this review was helpful images are of my own handset
5225	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	the nokia lumia 830 is the handset for the random photographers who love capturing everything on the go and share it with friends and family its 10 mp camera is awe inspiring as it can easily compete with any high end digital camera in terms of the image quality the pure view technology makes possible stunning low light photography and also ensures the images are brighter the optical image stabilization feature on the other hand is helpful while clicking images from a moving vehicle all these features are not only for clicking still images but also for video recording as well video recorded with lumia 830 do not only have clear image quality but also great sound quality and the credit goes to the 3 mic rich recording features like the large 5 inches ips lcd display bright colours 15 gb one drive storage and a host of apps together makes the nokia lumia 830 worthy of its price
5226	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	hi this is manik sharma few days before i had purchased lumia 830 at a price range of 20k the ui interface is amazing as compared to android devices it has 10mp pure view carl zeiss ois camera that gives you stunning pics in day light and superb pics in low lightas compared to other 10 or 13mpcamera phone it also supports wireless charging and nfc the built quality is outstanding  corning gorilla glass adds extra smoothness to the screen now say bye bye to flip covers in short a power pack device and indeed affordable flagship device
5227	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	wow really good phone quadcore 12 ghz cortexa7 1 gb ram windows 81denim nice im using windows phone more than 16 year no issue like hang or slow just i bought 830 nice phone and good speed and good camera really i got a good phone once android users use windows they never return to android 10mp camera  pureview technology  is very good fullhd video recarding nice  in store all apps are available  just buy it
5228	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	this phone is little expensive in my point of view but windows os is never about the specs they dont need mammoth specs to run smoothly day to day user experience is close to flawless camera is wonderful and build quality is awesome qi wireless capability is an additional plus to this phone  for those who want a good day to day use phone that looks beautiful can opt for this if they have extra money for aesthetics and build quality  for those who dont want to spend that extra bucks on the above 2 can take lumia 730 which offers similar specs and runs better than moto g
5229	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	i am very happy with this phone as someone moving from lumia 720 pros the camera is really good os is very smooth performance is good but not blazing quick battery lasts more than a day i love the wireless charging works well with my fatboy wireless charger till now i have not used the original charger yet wireless charging is way more convenient build quality looks absolutely amazing button on the side and the aluminum borders have a premium feel very good looking phone  cons black levels are not that deep from the screen design of the phones edges sometimes get a tad uncomfortable microsoft should start selling the replaceable back shell with the other color option  the chinese fake ones will damage the wireless charging bit i badly want a green one which will contrast well with a black phone
5230	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	awesome product loved it a lot  pros design  polycarbonate back and curved gorilla glass 3 in the front surrounded by a metal frame makes it feel a lot premium big 534 ips screen is bright sharp and makes watching videos or surfing the web a great experience optically image stabilized 10mp camera takes beautiful shots windows phone 81 was a huge step ahead of windows phone 8 and its going to be even better with windows 10  cons processor might be a little underpowered front facing camera lacks pixels only 09mp  overall a great phone with huge multitasking capabilities and a solid camera at a reasonable price
5231	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	lumia 830 is simply superb my first windows phone experience exploring a lot i love its camera features despite i surfed more than 3 hrs on internet only few around 10 slippage in the battery  though it doesnt much apps from windows store still i love it it has all the day today apps enough to survive 16 gb internal memory is the best part of it recently updated to windows 81 update 2 ram wouldve been little more around 15 gb at least but it is enough until you dont play any hard core games overall its a good phone to explore
5232	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	one of the best smartphone from microsoft comes with denim update and also camera comes with carl zeiss lens with pureview technology for capturing some amazing shots
5233	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	the os  i moved to the nokia lumia 830 from the nokia lumia 800 so windows phone is not new to me windows phone has matured enough to compete with other mainstream operating systems i would venture so far as to say that it is better than them in some respects  the phone  the nokia lumia 830 is a beautiful piece of hardware it is perfect for taking pictures and as usual i was blown away by the battery life with the advent of gestures beta the phone has become my perfect everyday companion  apps  mixradio is one application that sets windows phone apart from any other phone currently on the market almost every mainstream application has been redesigned with a metro interface which makes the entire experience coherent and easy to navigate  gaming  i used the lumia 830 mostly for games from the asphalt series plays beautifully without any lag  screendisplay  the display has a 720p resolution but you wont notice any difference from a full hd display for everyday use the 534 screen is a little big for users coming from smaller screens and unwieldy for one hand use  support  nokia care is amazing as usual i dont yet know how the takeover will affect these stores but support should be available for some time  the future  free windows 10 updates have been announced for all phones running windows 81 considering that windows 10 seeks to unify desktop mobile and tablet form factors into a single osstore it is definitely an exciting time to become a windows phone user if you arent one already
5234	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	what a lovely phone this is  im very pleased indeed and would recommend it to anyone wanting a windows phone  obviously it isnt an android phone and you shouldnt compare it with one  however the camera is fantastic it is really very slim and all in all a very good phone indeed
5235	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	its a beautifully designed phone  windows phone 81 os is clean  smooth and appealing
5236	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	fabulous product from nokiai love my lumia 830    kudos to amazon for great service and delivery in less than 48 hours also thanks for the amazing price 19999  lumia 830 a great devices 
5237	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	the mobile is a beauty though seems a bit costly in terms of configuration but the looks make it worth the purchase pure premium the windows platform and the nokia camera are just awesome just buy it without giving a second thought
5238	Nokia Lumia 830 (Black)	excellent phone 28k was too much but 20k is very acceptable not as good as 930 but very flexible with removable back cover battery and the biggest advantage of adding microsdsorely lacking in 930

5245	Panasonic Eluga U (Black)	i have the privilege to operate all types of mobiles from apple to samsung moto x and g and also panasonic elegant u p81 and p6151andp41in my  unbiased on merit opinion is that in 10k to 20 k bracket there is none better then elegant u and p81 in all spheres be it processor camera quality sleekness and eye catching presentation it is one product which is simply awesome only drawback where company can be faulted  is lackluster approach in upgrading of some of the best mobiles such as p11p51and p81from its present state of jellybeans to kitkat no wonder  a superb product has lost its lustre and being sold for as low as11k it is a sad commentary and yet panasonic management is lying in slumber very harsh and uncharitable but true

5281	Panasonic P55 (Pearl White)	though d delivery was late but a good deal with amazon cell z so gooda good cellphone if u r opting for kitkat95 out of 10 in good looks
5282	Panasonic P55 (Pearl White)	1st  and foremost i want a refund for this product   reasons are bad performance of the following which are crucial for mobile usage  1 battery 2 operation keys below the screen  the worst part of the product is the battery  the charge get discharged with out using the mobile 1st day  total call time  used for conversation was not even  20 minutes the battery charge was down by 51  before noon  2nd day same problem 3rd day same problem   return request reasons  performance or quality not adequate  the battery get discharged very fast  super fast   at a very minimal usage that is with  no down loads  no internet usage no messaging  less than 45 minutes calls no apps used no live wall papers  no video   2 the operation keys on the face of the mobile   below the screen  is also not fast   overall the trust on  panasonic has come to zero  guys from  panasonic  call me back  return my money take back your mobile   i want the refund asap
5283	Panasonic P55 (Pearl White)	i received the panasonic p55 just 34 days back and i would say its a good phone nice screen size cam quality in day light is good but not satisfactory at night times especially in dark areas another problem is the less internal memory of 4gb i knew about this before purchasing the phone but as i do not install games i am ok with it hope it does not start hanging after installing apps like whatsapp fbym and skypeoverall a nice phone at the price i purchased it for
5284	Panasonic P55 (Pearl White)	i have bought it for my wife and we are pleasantly surprised with the build quality though we had phones out there with better configuration in the same price range we are happy with the choice we made watching videos is a nice experience in this device as the sound quality is very good and the hd screen adding to the feel

5288	XOLO Q2100 Mobile (White)	bought this device as a gift and it took almost a week for the device to get delivered due to festival holidays have been using the device for almost 24 hours now and the usage has been heavy heres what it think about the device  what is good the screen is a delight to watch as the 55 inch panel powers up to vivid colors the build quality is good and feels sturdy and due to tapered edges and reduced thickness the device doesnt feel all that huge the speakers were pleasantly loud and clear  didnt really expect such clarity the stock android 442 is easy to use with minimum frills the it remote was easy to setup and worked effortlessly with my lg smart tv airtel dth and lg dvd player the finger print scanner was another surprise and was fairly simple to setup id however prefer the number lock the battery life is fairly decent  started the day will foll charge at 400 am and the usage has been fairly heavy throughout the day 17 hours later the batter was down to 50 overall build quality call quality user interface etc is all good  what could have been better the backlit capacitative keys were barely illuminated  for long i thought that there was no illumination the camera interface seems difficult and very nonintuitive the charging port and the cable provided dont seem to fit in too well at time the floating task widget bundled with the software seems distracting at times and i finally had to disable it one last thing i noticed a wierd thing with the browser  when i click the link on a page like 34newsgooglecoin34 a new tab opens up but teh url does not openmay need a few trials open the url  overall i think its a good phone with good value for moneyif you are looking for good large phablet ir sensor good battery backup additional memory support and fancy items like a finger print scanner

5343	Samsung Galaxy Alpha SM-G850Y (Frosted Gold)	i had a chance on this phone at a local store in hyderabad they are selling it for 38000 i am not sure the online price is so high  in my opinion first this phone is not worth buying at this price it should have been priced below 30k second samsung should stop copying apple i am not an apple fan but i respect ideas third if you are looking for buying you should buy after 6 months samsung is known to slash prices  but the phone is overall top notch just my wallet is not fitting this price
5344	Samsung Galaxy Alpha SM-G850Y (Frosted Gold)	currently im using this phone and its my 1st samsung phone its really sexy to look at one would definitely like it when you hold it in your hand size of the phone is very decent and almost like the size of iphone 6 battery life  its good last almost one entire working day resolution good  bright features  almost all the features which are currently there in the market  worth buying this set
5345	Samsung Galaxy Alpha SM-G850Y (Frosted Gold)	i have purchased this phone from another e retailer but i must say it a stunning phone for day to day use if you wanna buy a small size good looking phone with good features and battery life go for it secondly dont look at the 1800 mah  battery mark as it is a small screen phone that battery is enough for a days work
5346	Samsung Galaxy Alpha SM-G850Y (Frosted Gold)	initially when i saw the ad of this phone i decided that its my kind of phone and it is very beautiful  and executive  alpha means manly or macho it stands by its name love it very sleek superb finish and excellent performance  guys planning go for it

5385	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	if you are looking for a mobile between the price range of 12k  16k i assure you this is the best publicity for this mobile is little bit less when compare to samsung and moto g but lgs performance is great  the biggest competitor for this mobile is moto g and samsung galaxy quattro  all the three mobiles work on quad core processors 1gb ram  1 samsung galaxy quattros specifications are good but the performance is not upto the mark of other samsung mobile  2 moto g is a great hype but there are lot of drawback in it   1 motorola doesnt have large number of service centers when compare to lg   2 batteries are not removable so after 1 year if the battery is not performing good you need to curse yourself for buying it   3 no expandable storage   4 one the most important feature of mobile phone is to speak but most of the moto g users say that there is the problem with microphone and speaker and the call quality is very low and you can never compromise with it   5 after the android 442 update camera is not working properly in moto g and you it power off the device and power on to make it working 3 moto g positives are gorilla glass 3 hd screen higher ppi  why lg l90 dual is a better than moto g   1 all the drawbacks of moto g are recovered by lg and becomes as the strength to the l90 dual   2 this mobile can be used of everyday use weight is less compared to g and quattro 02 big display than moto g   3 the biggest advantage is with the 47 inch display the entire length of the phone is only 13 cms so it easily fits into your pocket   4 8 mp camera and 2540 mah battery is better than other mobiles   5 android 442 is preinstalled quad core processor gives its best performance   6 knock code q slide apps ir remote are exciting and useful  cons   1 front camera quality is low so no selfies   2 it doesnt have a hd display  comparing lot of mobiles lg l90 has lot of positive it is worth for its money performance over looks is made by lg
5386	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	overall excellent phone very light weight and fits in my hand perfectly display battery call quality video quality is excellent camera quality is good and have very good focusing ability speaker sound is ok   the main attraction of this phone is its features it has knock code for easy unlock guest mode for secure your private data q remote for control the tv dvd and blue rays capture plus for reading web pages offline and take snapshots of web pages smart forward function is very useful it is also supports for quick windowsmart window it records 1080p videos and the quality of videos are also good it has clear ips lcd display with corning gorilla glass 2 protection technology user interface and customization is also very good   so finally this phone is value for money for this price range
5387	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	the phone looks good with in its range it is not too excellent but pretty good with this price offering not the least it is very light weight and easy to carry being 4734 actually pretty happy with what i have  i was a apple customer and was finding it tough to restore my data  what i liked most from lg is its pc suite software which really helped to move all contacts sms memos media and photos easilly actually i was worrying about how to do this but pc suite does the trick
5388	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	this mobile is just amazing i personally liked the software that lg has provided way better then those samsung  htc cheapos tons of customization  eyecandy and best part is battery backup as it has a huge mammoth 2520mah battery it lasts approximately 1215hrs  edit after using this for 3months   1gb ram is not enough there is a noticeable lag sometimes while using the phone  cons   advertised as 8gb but only 33gb is available to user  camera has lots of noise  picture quality is not at par with other 8mpx phones pros  outstanding battery life  simply superb lg optimus ui lg software  good perfomance  reception  incall quality is excellent  knock code is a nice  welcomed addon  android 44
5389	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	strong points   1 great sar value  its very important i advice you to do some research specially moto buyers 2 sound in headphones is amazing i used audiophile krk headphones to check the music 3 video playback was very smooth i tried various types of videos and movies 4 call quality and voice is great 5 remote feature  a lot more useful than you would think you can control many devices with your phone and it actually works 6 smart forward allows you to receive calls if you are talking on other sim so you wont miss calls 7 option for moving most apps to sd card allows to free the phone memory 8 solid build quality  you can feel quality of lg if you take the phone in hand for the first time seems so strong and durable 9 knock code is the best feature  once you get used to this feature you cant live without it 10 fm radio has good reception and has useful recording fuction 11 using the phone with one hand is easy even if you dont use the builtin one hand operation feature 12 good recording  the noise cancellation microphone provides clean recording capability 13 good camera  the photos are much better than other 8 mp phones 14 good battery life  goes for 5 days if you use it just for calls with wifi on all the time 2 days if heavy use with skype  whatsapp notes chrome news apps etc 15 lg ui is one of the best the interface is very userfriendly and all options are well organized  weak points   1 no notification light 2 no backlight for bottom bottons but you get used to in a week once you develop muscle memory 3 slow battery charging  charging is capped at 1 amp so even if you connect fast chargers like 2 amps it will still charge at 1 amp 4 the sim card switch button at the bottom is more pain than gain accidental presses are annoying but you get used to it 5 no otg support  you cant connect pen drive and other usb devices directly to phone 6 slippery design  prone to accidental drops from hands if not careful because of the slippery back design 7 asphalt 8 the popular game doesnt work as of now

5393	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	after a research of almost 4 months i bought this mobile i am writing this review after using it for 20 days  the build quality of this phone is excellent 45  5  the performance and multitasking 45  5  battery performance 5  5 for normal usage of 4hrs wifi 2hrs 2g calling 1hrs gaming gave me the battery life of almost 2days this is far better than from any other smartphone brands we cant find 2540mah battery even in htc or any brand for this price  even thought this has qhd screen the display is excellent as if it was a hd screen 45  5  the customized lg optimus ui is very easy and attractive to use 5  5  the response time of camera is very fast and it does its job very well in day light i never tested it in night  4  5 day light  389gb free space for user out of 8gb rom is pretty decent  i really enjoy the knock code function  of course the device is very light weight and it accepts normal sim we dont have to cut it  and finally the quality of earphones is not good i bought a samsung earphone for 650 inr  the volume of ring tone could have been better
5394	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	this product is nice and worth trying only drawback is camera quality which is not so good for both front and rear wish lg would have done something better on camera and screen resolution it is a qhd phone not hd and this is the only negative factor for this phone amazon service was good product was in good shape and new and delivery was on time amazon is a great place to buy products
5395	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	i wont go into the specifications since that is generally quite decently covered elsewhere i will go straight to the issues i face  the lack of an ambient light sensor means that you have to manually adjust the brightness everytime you step outside a building while that is still ok there are times when i have found that the phone did not allow me to increase the brightness beyond 60 indicating that the temperature is too high  i had to try very hard to use my phone i was using it for directions while on the road because the 60 brightness was absolutely inadequate against the bright sunlight  apart from that a very nice phone with everything one could ask for i use it quite a lot with wifi etc and most of the time the battery support is good call quality is clear phone is very light so its easy to carry around  and after having used galaxy note 1 and 2 the smaller size seems just right for my hands
5396	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	it is more than my expectations all enquiries internet banking and share trading in reliance platform are possible now i need not purchase a laptop lg software is very fascinating for the first three days i was disappointed by its operations now everything is in my fingertip thank you amazon for your fast and prompt delivery
5397	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	hi people i ordered dis on 1st and got it on 2nd first impressions of da lg l90 black color are da phone is vry light weighedwith a good 4734 qhd display  da size of da phone is just perfct fits cosily in my handmuch bettr den its rivalsxperia e3 and m2 angd moto g2 although da display is a qhd only it doesnt  look n feel like one  feels much richer den it it has a massive 2540mah batterywhich lasts me almost 15 days with gaming calling chatting on whatsaap n using wifi now n then  da 8 mp hd camera is nt dat badis good enough for daily usage n lg has loaded it with da best ui possible for dis price so overall a good phone for da price ur payingcompare it to othr devices samsungsonyhtcmicromax and ul get ur answer as i did cheerzzz  tc
5398	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	first i orderd moto g2 from flipkartbut iam faced lot of problems with that mobile like call problemssome times i didnt hear anything even ring alsoand over heating problems and battery backup is very bad i returned it to flipkart and i ordered lg l90 dual in amazon they gabber deals deliverd on time this mobile is using since from one month i didnt face any problem  this mobile gives me nice battery backup no heating problems cliptray is very usefull to me 1080p video recording is good but in dark time camera is not good front camera is not good quick remote is working nice but it is not working with sattelite boxdish box it is only works to tv and dvd knock on code feature is good quick memo and qslide features are very good overall iam fully satisfied with this mobile
5399	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	this phone goes beyond my expectations the screen is big bright and clear it may not be hd but videos and games are crystal clear even the icons on the screen look great i saw one person gave it 1 star that is nuts this phone has clear sound loud speaker 4g is lightning fast huge battery life front and rear facing camera gps for a phone in the 12000rs range you cant go wrong not to mention its loaded with the latest version of android kitkat 442 sure it may not compare to samsung s5s then again you will pay extra for a person like me who is not a business drone or a tech geek or if your life does not revolve around a phone this phone goes beyond my needs dont listen to the 1 star haters if you are on a budget or just cant see paying for a phone look no further
5400	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	i have been using this phone for the past 3 weeks and i am totally happy with its performance  earlier i was using samsuny galaxy s advance and i need to recharge it twice or thrice a day lg phone is giving me one full day battery charge availability and i am happy about it  sim switching operation is a breeze just press a button and you can toggle between two sims color code for two individual sim enables easy identity of official call or personal call we can see the per day quantity as well as monthly cumulative call duration  messages  data usage this option is helpful for controlling the phone bill  call quality  signals reception quality is exellant  no hangovers were observed till now  i recommend others to buy this phone
5401	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	first off great experience with amazon received the phone within 24 hours with next day delivery packing was good just got the phone delivered today and below are my first impressions after playing with it for about 5 hours  as for the phone its quite good to handle is sleek and light weight looks good the phone is quite snappy no lags at all so far and great to use kit kat out of the box music output is good  videos great to watch on the ideal sized screen battery backup seems quite good too call quality is quite clear also  only disappointment is image quality especially in low light but still not a deal breaker  overall great value for money at this price especially since we can use a memory card  no constraint on memory
5402	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	its a good phone  the plus points are heavy multitasking than any other android phones most advanced android kitkat ui optimus 30 with qslide you can watch a video along with messaging below the video playback or can simultaneously use 2 apps the call pop window never disturbs or interrupts usage of any apps while an incoming call not seen on any other android phone  the negatives of the phone are front camera is only 03 mp very poor clarity no otg support cant update to android lollipop no ambient light sensor more than 600mb ram out of usable 883mb ram is needed for the kitkat os with ui optimus 30 ie not more than 250 mb are available for applications
5403	LG L90 Dual D410 (Black)	lg90 nice mobile but i having some problem in connecting to wifiother than that awesome  delivery please make sure that delivery is ondoor because ur delivery boy called and told me to come to this place not only me to every customer

5445	Sony Xperia Z1 (Purple)	im using this mobile more than a year  three reasons why i purchased this mobile is 1 premium finish 2 water proof 3 camera  i have installed all sony camera plugins and nearly 200 apps the mobile never hanged even in multi tasking in day light the pics are awesome with auto intelligent mode  and even look professional with background defocus mode  when my mobile gets hot after playing games i even keep my mobile in deep freezer for 10 mins p  surround sound  clear audio in walkman app you really need good headphones for listening music bravia engine enhances the color of videos automatically compared to other mobiles the colors are rich  when my mobile dropped for the first time from a height of 4 feet on hard floor my heart stopped a second but to my shock not even a single scratch or dent was there on my mobile  i take calls  pics in rain too the mobile touch behaves a bit different under water i surely wash it every week make sure all side flaps are closed properly  i dont say go for it blindly but once you start using it  you love it 603 d
5446	Sony Xperia Z1 (Purple)	by the time the phone stopped charging the return window of amazon was exhausted tried to get replacement from sony directly no success finally one month back gave for service till now despite calling the phone has not been replaced or rectified service centre says they have to hear from headquarters not even able to escalate the issue after my bitter experience i did some research and there were horror stories plenty sample  now how can i recommend this phone or for that matter any phone from sonymobile to any one in india
5447	Sony Xperia Z1 (Purple)	when sony xperia z1 released i was one of the first customers to buy the handset from flipkart with lot of excitementbut trust me i am experiencing pathetic customer service from the customer care and service center department  sony being a worldwide brand for electronics and home appliances every customer expects to get prompt and appropriate service for their products but in my case i failed to receive satisfactory service for a premium product like xperia z18230  1 on 24th december when i woke up in the morning i saw my xperia z1 display having a crack from inside the cabinet there was no damage on the external glass but however the display had cracked from inside a single scratch cannot be seen from the external where the display has cracked8230  2 in my case the local service center people are asking me to pay 18000 rupees to replace my handset completely instead of replacing the display although my handset is under warranty and the display had also cracked on its own from inside there is no sign of external damage on the screen  3 sony customer care executives and sony service center are not well trained and they do not understand customer grievances they are least bothered about the customer satisfaction and only think of ways to extract more money from the customer nobody bothered to give me a callback to update me about the status i had to keep following up with the customer care helpline as well as the sony service center i know few acquaintances who had similar experience with service center bhubaneswar  4 my handset contained some photographs in the internal storage with my father who died this year and that was more valuable to me i requested the service center to take the backup of my phone but they refused that it cannot be done as display is cracked if i can do the data backup after exploring the internet for few hours then why cant the technicians employed by sony do the same  arent they qualified enough  5 while i handed over the handset to the service center there was a small area of damage to the display but when i received the handset from them the area of damage had increased significantly i have the photographs available with me  6 i had heard that sony xperia z1 is a flagship model and during service period the service center provides a temporary handset but in my case no temporary handset was also issued to me  7 after sending an email to sony senior management in india sony head office support team sent an email stating i have to pay 50 of mrp for refurbished handset without accessories and 80 of mrp rs 28500 for fresh handset without accessories8230 prices offered by local sony service center and head office vary significantly which proves there is no baseline price8230 whatever happens to your handset sony people will simply ask you to pay another 20k 30k instead of replacing the faulty equipment8230  it8217s really frustrating as sony customer service people are asking me to pay another 28k for the handset which is under warranty and the screen has also cracked on its own due to faulty designbad quality equipment being used  trust me guys the service being offered by samsung for galaxy s4 which is a comparable model with z1 is much better than sony8230 sony is having the worst after sales service8230 i would like to request everyone not to go by brand instead buy the products having better after sales service to make your life hassle free82308230

5458	Sony Xperia Z1 (Purple)	pathetic worst and very expnsive for this chap quality product
5459	Sony Xperia Z1 (Purple)	the phone is of excellent quality and is value for money i opted for next day delivery and the phone was delivered earlier than expected though there have been couple of mentions on the speaker quality i did not really feel the instrument to be lacking on any front there is great ease in charging and the battery management option is excellent i was using lenovo s920 earlier than this but its performance was perhaps the most pathetic one  the only misleading thing is that on the website it was mentioned that the mrp is rs44990 and the price is rs26900 not sure when these prices were applicable but the price at which i bought was rs25099 as against the price on the box rs27990 web site claims a savings of 44 comparing against the mrp i think it was at the time of launching the phone but the real savings against the price on the box are only rs1090 nevertheless the phone is value for money i dont repent on this front  i suggest you to go for it no need to spend double the amount for an iphone etc

5474	Micromax Canvas Elanza 2 A121 (White)	very good product and value for money where you get hd resolution display 1 gb ram and good quality  the pros are on the higher side than cons  i felt that the audio speaker should have been a better one with dual or something the earpiece audio quality is excellent without any lags  to describe in one line  excellent product with value for money and features of phone worth 15k  thanks
5475	Micromax Canvas Elanza 2 A121 (White)	good product everythng is good expect for 3 things battery backup very less camera is not good and heats up while using internet and playing games if it was normal i would have understood but it heats up more than usual
5476	Micromax Canvas Elanza 2 A121 (White)	yea its a very good fone  some drawbacks are  poor rear camera  not so good screen visibility  got heat up a bit after 20 to 30 mint of use  beyond this every things and features of this fone r just fabulous  so if camera is not ur main priority then u should look for this fone  else try searching another fone  at the price tag this fine really deserve 9 out of 10 
5477	Micromax Canvas Elanza 2 A121 (White)	i bought it on diwaliat 6670 it was a nyc phonewhich gives a gud battery backup and an 8mp camonly defect i found on this was the internal storage capacity1gb for apps installation thats gudbut phone storage is also 1 gbwe cant store data directly to external sdwe have to move it frm phone storagetotally its a superb phoneany one can buy
5478	Micromax Canvas Elanza 2 A121 (White)	some internal problem are occurred screensoundspeed look is very good but i compare with samsung mobile having 5mp camera i found that camera and battery of samsung mobile is  better from this mobile this mobile declare 8mp camera in it but  after studying i found that it is equal to 5mp camera battery backup is very badi suggest this phone is not very good
5479	Micromax Canvas Elanza 2 A121 (White)	product is really good got good reviews from friends also whoever saw it liked it very much im still worried about the warrant part i heard from a mobile dealer shop that company dont entertain warranty issues on online purchases need clarifications on this because this will increase my confidence more on online sales and specially on amazon
5480	Micromax Canvas Elanza 2 A121 (White)	i bought this phone in september 2014its an awesome phone in terms of looksnd micromax has really raised the standard the screen resolution is fantastici fell for the phones good looks128515u can play high end gamesas it is loaded with 1 gb ram which gives a descent performance overall its a very nice phone9786
5481	Micromax Canvas Elanza 2 A121 (White)	this micromax model is not good as compared to other micromax old products too much problem

5485	Sony Xperia T3 (Black)	its goodas expected it would have been better if the handset was specified with dual sim facility but over all a good handset with awesum claritysound qualitygood camerai m quite satisfied
5486	Sony Xperia T3 (Black)	i ordered the phone without seeing it for real i was shocked when i saw the size of it i was using an xperia x8 till then within 2 days i became very familiar with it also the such a screen size is very much helpful while using social networking sites  no lag good sound quality camera also fine didnt explore much but didnt like the headset they gave i was looking out to buy asus zenfone 2 or xaoimi mi4i but this one is perfectly fine and i have no regrets now  i use only single sim hence a dual sim phone was not necessary another feature that attracted me is the battery life im getting around 2 to 25 days with all apps closed after its use 45 hours of playing songs 23 hrs whatsapp over wifi
5487	Sony Xperia T3 (Black)	its simply awesomesound clarity is crystal clearlightning speed processordisplay clarity is goodcamera clarity is also nice and decentonly problem is the delivery timei got the phone after 20 days

5493	Sony Xperia T3 (Black)	the product was delivered as promised but the display is not as bright as samsung phones also the camera despite the high pixel count is average and does not have many options to change settings or maybe it is just the screen

5508	Panasonic T31 (White)	my humble appeal to all indians plz dont buy panasonic products since panasonic has stopped providing repairservice its products in warranty period in case of fault i have confirmed the same with its customer care center lot of complaints are pending with panasonic made by its indian buyers for not honoring the warranty by panasic plz support those innocenthelpless buyers living with panasonics fauty products despite of warranty assured by panasonic and save more indians from panasonic
5509	Panasonic T31 (White)	good phone for low price can play all games without any lag or stuck but viewing angle is not good when u look from the right side superfast 3g connectivity i got 315 mbps on bsnl network and 723 mbps on idea 3g and thats amazing for those want fast connectivity i would recoment this phone it has tethering software built in which helps u to connect ur mobile internet to ur pc or laptop and its better than using data cards as i can get 3 to 7 mbps netspeed without any disturbance battery is ok but drains fast while browsing net camera is 5mp but u get only 3mp quality sadly after 1 year in jan 2015 my phone slip from my hand and display got broken the real problem was that the spare display is not available anywhere and its a mess see iam adding a photo  the phone good and best in this range be carefully about the display problem i recoment this phone thank u
5510	Panasonic T31 (White)	santosh thakur  the only problem i faced was to paste the protective screen on to the phone n spite of my best efforts it left out many dots on the screen
5511	Panasonic T31 (White)	firstly its a vga front camera not 2 mp as falsely advertised by amazon front camera does not work for skype calls i mainly bought the phone for skype calls secondly the phone went dead just like that after 2 months of purchase so i have to hunt for a panasonic service center now thirdly why is reliance digital selling this phone if panasonic service is not available even for phones under warranty i read someones review below

5526	Sony Xperia Z3 Compact (Black)	have been using this phone since a month now here is what i have experienced  1 size its the perfect size for a phone prior to this i had a lumia 1520 which was too cumbersome to handle  2 display it is good clear and sharp however one thing is that the autobrightness does not work as i expected i have to manually adjust the brightness in sunlight and turn it down indoors  3 speakers not so loud the back of the phone vibrates at full volume when playing youtube videos setting the equalizer to full all 5 sliders to max position does help a little with the loudness also the speaker is located at the front of the phone so if the phone is in the pocket it is not as loud as a phone that would have speakers at the bottom of the phone or some place where they dont get muffled  4 camera camera is really good even in low light i use the default sony camera app and i have found no reason to complain manual settings are cumbersome and deeply nested  5 battery life superb lasts me over two days with moderate to heavy usage 3g always on locationwiffi etc when needed  6 usability a copy paste is an issue  i recently found out that one needs to double tap the text in a text box to be able to select and copy it phone numbers cannot be copied from the call log  one has to edit the phone number and then long press it in the text box to copy it quite a bad experience  b default sony lock screen gets unlocked if you swipe in any direction that along with the easy depressability of the power button means it can easily unlock itself in your pocket and you wont know what has happened to solve this either you can use a pin or pattern unlock with default screen i use locker master 3rd party lock screen which has a swipe to unlock only left to right swipe will unlock it  c charging the phone requires you to open the flap that covers the usb port that cover is quite flimsy so i bought a magnetic charging cable but that is not a very strong magnetic connection so unless you keep the phone flat on a table it will keep disconnecting  d playing music through car audio not possible with usb connection unless you have the music on your sd card  i dont have an sd card for this phone yet work around is you can use an rca to rca cable and plug one end into your phones headphone jack and the other into your car stereos aux port  e usb mass storage only works with sd card it wont expose the underlying file system and so you cannot just copy documents mp3s etc like we used to be able to earlier  f volume cannot be changed when screen is locked this may seem like a small thing but its immensely useful doesnt work here  g music widget does not show up when playing music in walkman app you have to drag the notification bar to see the music app or go to the app itself cannot change tracks from lock screen tried with default lock screen as well as locker master  h reject with message when the phone rings the screen comes on and there is an option to 34reject with message34 that can be activated by swiping from bottom to up this can accidentally happen when taking the phone out of the pocket its more of an annoyance and again shows a lack of attention to details and usability while designing the phone app  7 durability i have purchased a back case for this phone to protect it from scratches and drops phone seems sturdy enough and so far no issues
5527	Sony Xperia Z3 Compact (Black)	pros snappy perfomance great battery life above average camera airtel 4g support support for lossless audio format flac out of the box waterproofing only in clean water not sea or even pool with chlorine lets you answer a call while cooking and even wash it under tap water in case of any dirt or stain on the surface if you were in love with the dimensions of samsung galaxy s2 as compared to the 5 inch phablet monsters then this is the perfect upgrade now with the lollipop update which rolled out in the 2nd week of april even in india  the deal just got sweeter the battery can last for 2 days with wifi and bluetooth on and moderate usage and definitely for more than a day with heavy usage as long as you do not spend half a day on maps with gps enabled it is truly a relief to know that there is no more hunting for power sockets as soon as the sun sets cons the front and back is glass which makes it slippery beyond your imagination i had kept the phone on a wooden surface with around 3degree tilt and the next thing i hear is the sound of the phone falling on the floor after sliding off the surface thank god it only left a very minor scratch on the body speaking on the phone while using your ear and shoulder as support would only be possible after putting on a separate case the charging point under the nylon flapplugfor water proofing is an inconvenience as well as prone to damage hence purchasing a magnetic charging cable also would be highly recommended
5528	Sony Xperia Z3 Compact (Black)	i have been using this phone since several months the phone is very easy on hands and the performance is also near to top notch there are minor lags in ui sometimes the dialer is slow rest every thing is good i find the flip to bring out the charging port irritating but as the phone is waterproof so no complains i dont understand why the auto mode in camera only supports 8mp though in manual mode 20mp is there but not every person is pro at using manual mode overall camera is good low light photography is also fine battery easly lasts for a day with extensive uses with android 444 apps cant be transfered to sdcard even apps whatsapp multimedia contants cant be transfer to sdcard by default i guess might lollipop update this might be solved but havent got the update yet call quality is decent sometime there issues but that might be due to service provider price is a subjective issue but i think its more on the higher side i find the dimensions of the phone camera as its major usp overall a very elegant and capable phone satisfied
5529	Sony Xperia Z3 Compact (Black)	its been 3 months now using the product its an awesome phone for someone who is looking for a small yet flagship spec device like me hardware specifications  almost the same as the bigger version the xperia z3  pros great screen 46 inches flagship spec in a small form factor some might find this a con slim bezels larger screen on a smaller area great camera 20mp manual 8mp wide in automatic amazing camera features 4k recording slow motion video recording to name a few great battery 2600 mah will last you 2 days on average use waterproof dust tight looks good  dropped it from a moving 2wheeler 40 kmph nothing broke glass on 2 sides but there were superficial damages  cons overpriced no 1080p display for the price 720p should be more than enough for 46 inches though lack of aluminium on the sides like the z3 flaps for usb charging  might get loose should keep securing it can be solved by using magnetic charging cable  overall its the closest to a phone ive dreamed about  compact and powerful
5530	Sony Xperia Z3 Compact (Black)	the device i own is white so fortunately smudges etc dont show on the glass back its an amazing device the battery life is incredible the ui is great its yet to hang even once only complaint is that sony is yet to release a lollipop update which is unfortunate but works great for now
5531	Sony Xperia Z3 Compact (Black)	got my phone after 2 daysgood service from amazonphone working welli am using it for last 1 monthtill now no problem
5532	Sony Xperia Z3 Compact (Black)	memory card cover and sim card cover is not fitting properly inside it otherwise the phone is good

5541	Xolo Play 8X-1100 (Black)	1  heating problem sooo heated when playing game or using net 2  average battery 4 hrs onnet and max 5 hrs game 3  battery drain very fastly after full charging
5542	Xolo Play 8X-1100 (Black)	 i bought my xolo play 8x1100 imei  911387550119456 on nov 2014 and yes i was very happy with its performance in all the areas within four months its mic stopped functioning  i sent it for service and for a long time it was kept on under repair status  after 15 days of period which they commit as a maximum time to resolve it they were not able to repair and called me and offered me another new mobile whose configuration was too low compared to the one i had i strongly denied the offer and insisted to have my old mobile back  after too many follow up emails and phone calls i got a call from one of the manager mr j from xolos noida service center and he sounded very positive and informed that he will personally take care of all the pains and resolve my queries not naming that guy and not putting his personal number as after all he is also a professional  as the mobile was not repaired in the time he committed i called him again and he said he will check the status and get back  later on he called that they are not having the hardware and will be sending a brand new phone of the same model and he also dispatched the mobile on next day  on receiving the mobile while started in the service station itself i was shocked to see 2 pirated movies copied into a so called brand new phone someones personal message of idea which i never use as a sim  on usig it further i also found that the cameras quality was pathetic and also the phone heated too quickly on top of that there was a permenant black spot on the screen  i still believed that mr j is a good guy and called him and very positively he said that you send back me the phone and i will take care that you do not face any problems he was also kind enough to understand my personal urgency to have a smart phone and said that once your urgency is over you can send me and i will take care of everything  i sent the brand new second handed mobile for service again with a letter to mr j describing all the problems and also phoned hime with details of work order number ie 510004166126 and again received a very positive response  after a long waiting period no response and on calling i received that they wont be able to replace the mobile this time but he has instructed to the team to replace as many parts as possible and do regirous quality check  and on all subsequent calls they were killing the time with the reasons like unavailability of the time was always something which is shared  when i talked to him last time he informed that he will be dispatching it soon when i asked that all the points in my letter have been taken care or not then he asked me for a copy of the letter again and on receiving it no response again and there has been 4 days to it  luckily i get him on call again after too many unsuccssful attempts by phone email sms and he informed that as they have received the letter yesterday only they are now checking against it  boss this information was there on your wo also a letter was sent with this and also it was told to you number of times over the call but still you want me to here this piece of   now that guy does not receive my phone calls most of the time and when i am lucky enough to get him on the call he keeps telling the stories that it will be dispatched today but again that has never happened  now during the warranty period these people keeps the mobile with them most of the time and also keeps fooling you with false commitments  multiple issues with the local service center are not mentioned here because their sins are too low compared to the main service center
5543	Xolo Play 8X-1100 (Black)	the mobile is too good  im using it for more than 1 month  till now i dont faced any issues
5544	Xolo Play 8X-1100 (Black)	do not buy this phone honestly i really liked xolo but i dont know what they have done in this model everything is good but battery is really bad in standby all services running but no chattingcalling it falls in 78 hours if calling it gives hardly 25 hours of continuous talk if you play heavy games hardly 1 hour it falls so you have charge your phone at least 2 times even in moderate usage if you are travelling no way to keep battery backup regardless of what ever power saver mode are you using and all these power consumption issue is not just because of low capacity battery provided here it is also because of highly unoptimized os may be if this get a lollipop update so this problem get solved but that is just a hope so do not buy go for a phone having at least 2500 mah lipolimer battery
5545	Xolo Play 8X-1100 (Black)	i used to do internet whole day with a high speed internet connectivity through wifi connection it never hang up only issue is the battery everyday i have to charge the phone at night but except the charging issue it a nice phone with high technical specification and i am very satisfied with this phone

5567	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Orange)	i bought this phone for my mom my mother accidently dropped this in water and its still working fine it even fell down on concrete a couple of times its pretty handy and has decent build quality the design is neat and simple even if the camera is 2mp the quality is impressive and looks it was taken by something more than just 2mp the front cam is average but the fact that a budget phone like this having a front cam is plaudable i have been an android user but i must say i am pretty impressed by the windows os i would totally recommend this for those who are looking to buy a backup phone or for gifting one for their parents
5568	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Orange)	a great phone for the price and has shown excellent battery life so far the orange is matte orange and not glossy as the pictures seemed to indicatei wanted the matte so that isnt an issue i bought it for my mom in lieu of an asha series phone that she was using the touch is noticeably a lot better and ive experienced very little lag in the app experience even though they are installed on the sd card
5569	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Orange)	dont buy microsoft  lumia 435 battery backup very weak
5570	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Orange)	its just an awesome phone best for teenagers who loves design and colours excellent job microsoft

5576	Microsoft Lumia 435 (Dual SIM, Orange)	good
5577	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Orange)	i bought this phone for my mom i was looking for a relatively small screen and user friendly software  since microsoft phones have the most user friendly user interface choosing a lumia phone was a no brainer  everything is decent and as expected although i wish the rear camera had better resolution at this price but still not that bad  one thing i did not like is the thickness yet i purchased this for my mom since its easier to handle its super bulky as per current standards stay away from this phone if you want a slim good looking phone and and and avoid orange color i immediately replaced the back cover for my orange phone  software is easy to use and swift with no lags or hangs whatsoever
5578	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Orange)	awesome product apps are very user friendly the only drawback is that the back cover is very ridiculous to open and one have to be careful in doing so otherwise it might got broken
5579	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Orange)	the phone looks very smart the device is quite intelligent the battery drowns with 3g network otherwise easily lasts a whole day impressive camera front camera is not a feature to be mentioned as its 03 fast processor smooth touch screen  overall its a worth buy in this price
5580	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Orange)	excellent phone as per features of the phone
5581	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Orange)	i received it on time and till now its working fine
5582	Microsoft Lumia 532 (Dual SIM, Orange)	yes its a best mobile phone with this rangeespecially speed processinglookscamera operating system 81i love it

5605	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	got my canvas nitro yesterday im just loving itit is simply the best phone  this price range working smoothlygud camera qualitygud battery backupno heating problem as somebody complaintd and  im completely happy with the service of amazon
5606	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	edit  one seller is selling this for 16k the real price of this phone is around 12k  first of all i wanna thank xiaomi only because of their agressive pricing we in india now can have great speced devices from micromaxxolo etc for an affordable price nitro a310 is without any doubtbest you can get for the price as of this writing  lets talk about the device now is it worth it  display and build quality 5 inch hd 720p display i am actually not disappointed for this not having a 1080p screenhuman eye cant see anything higher than 300ppi and more pixels means more battery the display consumes 5 inch 720p is the ideal combination in my opinion oleophobic coating antifinger print coating is really a nice thing to haveit has a leather back panel offering better grip  processor and ram this is powered by a mediatek octacore chipset mt6592w clocked at 17ghz and has a quadcore mali 450 mp4 gpu clocked at 700 mhz the performance of this combination is really great and you would hardly find any issues during playing hd games and all 2gb ram ensures good multitasking  battery one of the mistakes many indian oems did with their octacore phones is packing them with a small battery micromax on the other hand decided to pack this with a larger 2500mah battery to ensure you wont run out of battery before the day ends  camera  13mp 22 aperture sony sensor rear camera and a 5mp 24 aperture bsi front camera this is the same combination you can see in xolo 8x1100 and looking at the specsthey both have the same front and back camera sensors overall performance of the camera is sure gonna be goodexpect noise to creep in when the light drops a 24 aperture front cameragets in more light to get better selfies  software this is running android 44 kitkat and i hope micromax will care to update this with android l when it gets official since there is no official announcement on this i suspect this to take timemaybe 34 months after android l source code is fully out micromax is boasting a lot of custom added software features to the stock android kitkatyou can see the details on that on their official websitestrangelycanvas nitro doesnt support otgso you cant plug in your pendrives  verdict overall canvas nitro is really a great device for the pricevalue for moneythere are some other octacore devices at this price rangebut they are powered by a mt6592m processor clocked at 14ghz and most have a 2000mah battery the obvious direct contenders are the new moto g second gen and xiaomi mi3moto g has some cool software features and im pretty sure it will get software updates very fast compared to micromax or any other oems in india android l update is guaranteed toobut whether canvas nitro will get l update remains to be seenif you want a phone with better specs like gorilla glassdual speakers etcxolo 8x1100 is also therebut only comes with a 2100mah batteryoverall canvas nitrospecwise is a real value for money device  edit now you have some other devices with same 17ghz octacore available for similar prices eg karbonn octane plus
5607	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	micromax canvas nitro a310  total value for money but with the following exceptions  1 speaker sound quality is just average 2 ram is preloaded with many poor and unuseful apps 3camera good in daylight but decent in low light much better than what i expectedfront camera is brilliant for selfies wide angles photos can be captured 4mainly problem is batteryfrom 100 to 70 mobile will works fineafter 70 battery drains very very very fast and it goes to 6 5default storage option given in settings does not work cant install  move apps in sd card 6if you use rear 13mp camera for while also it becomes heat 7build quality phones back panel is an eye popper leather finish is best very light in weight 8quick look feature is nice as htc link feed  overall its a pretty good phone
5608	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	i had purchased micromax nitro from amazon for rs 10970 micromax nitro seems to be rebranded version of coolpad  halo f1 phone which is available in china i am using mmx nitro for last 3 months and it is really good in terms of battery backup  performance and display micromax after sales service had improved much i had past experience with my micromax unite 2 which had got complaint with back light led got repaired  within 4 days from mmx service center at kannur  it would be better if mmx pushed update to bring usb otg support otg support can8217t be fixed by using apps like otg helperotg checkerotg diagonisticsnexus media importer etc etc so better wait for updateplease all mail this basic need to micromaxhope micromax will take care of this in upcoming android l updatenote  asus had provided update to make otg support on its device  i have rooted my mmx nitro using kingo root softwareit is very easy to root and uroot using kingo root app  battery backup seems to be too good more than 2500 mah battery i think mmx had done some tweaks to improve battery performance16 hours of battery backup as per ndtv video loop testmicromax nitro had got li polymer battery which is not mentioned in many review sites li  polymer is always better than li ion batteries for all those who are facing the fast battery drain after and around 70 should do a software updatego to settingsabout phonesoftware update micromax has already fixed the battery calibration issue  install sdfix app and link2sd card app then you will be able to convert the system apps to user app by using link2sd card appit thus helps to uninstall true caller and other unwanted boalwaresphone should be rootedsdfix app help to deletemovemodify files within the thirdparty app like mx playerfile manager etc  update clean master app if any one are facing restarting problem  nitro users please dont wait for android l updateroot your phone using king root app and install the following applications  1 greenify app will give great backup by hibernating apps when not in usenote i have installed more than 80 apps in my phone still i have 950 mb free this is only due to this app  2 xposed frame work and gravity box  can customize quick setting drop down from the top to your wish can bring torch 2g3g mode etc etc in the quick settings and much more optionscan make transparent drop down drawercan rearrange the tiles ect  you can do much more than what ardroid l offers by just installing the above apps on your stock android 442 romno need of going for custom roms  those who are complaining about battery back must read ndtvgogi rana digit battery review for nitro battery back up if you use for only calls then its giving 2 days backup if i use only watsapp then its giving more than 1 day if i use watsapp and fb messenger it gives for almost 1 day if i use browsing then it will give for only halfday  no use of anti fingerprint coating since we use screen guard over iti came to know from some other website that there is some sort of screen protection other than gorilla glass for this setso no worries  rear camera quality is good though low light shots are not that great use 360 camera to capture better pics front camera is excellent gesture support for camera can capture pics very fast and smart using v gesturenot available in high end devices like xiaomi mi3lumia 730 etc  video pause if you look away from the screen while watching videos has almost pure stock android so great options for customization can take 360 degree view of an object using multi angle shoot option inbuilt in stock camera app  overall nice phone with very good battery backup
5609	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	a good phone da only prob is being micromax its hardware is not as good as it says such as 13 mp is no better than 8 mp and da rest is da same bt all in all not a bad deal
5610	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	its ok product you cant expect superb quality at this price but xiaomi mi3 is exception lot of bloatware which can shoot up your mobile bills if your kids are using your mobile rs99 per sms for games most of the games are free for 23 level then all of sudden a pop up comes and by mistake click on yes will charge you you cant uninstall these games but somehow i was able to disable them finally the screen guard provided was not good quality  the launcher is slow and sluggish i used cheetah screen becomes pretty smooth and next launcher is even better with lots of customization if you are willing to pay this amount go for xiaomi mi3 or lenovo mobile which are coming with better price features and battery
5611	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	problems with this phone  1 phone has frequent heating problem which is really significant 2 battery  if indicator shows even 50 or more still battery dried down within 2 hours many a times without any reasonable reason   rest all about this phone is perfect as i assumed build quality screen resolution camara os ect all works great other then above 2 complain no negatives for the phone
5612	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	i have gone through  phone like moto g asua zenphone 5  but i found  canvas nitro the best  pros 1very good display  clearity  which  u will not  find in moto g 2 smooth touch response  and aleophobic coating makes  it much clear in viewing 3superfast application response 4 asus phone  comes  with custom android  which i personally  hates however  nitro comes with stock  android  gui which  any one will like 5much better camera  than asus zenphone  5 and moto g 2nd  u will not get such a good selfie  phone in  this  much price  moto g and asus nowhere  stand in comparison  with selfie 6 battery backup is pretty good than moto g nd zenphone  and also it comes  with  external battery  which later u can easily  buy online  within  700 or less 7 really  durable back cover  and will not  get even  single scratch  leather looking plastic  is really  good numerous  times nitro dropped  from my hand from  sufficient  height  but nothing happened 8 will not get dust in the screen as its very tightly  packed  as compared  to old micromax  phones which  used to get dust inside  screen  cons 1 no otg support
5613	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	i am using it since 3 weeks its working good 1 no lag while playing heavy games 2 works fine if multiple apps running simultaneously 2 gb ram is excellent for this 3 camera is good with some nice features however selfie front camera pics come somewhat darker than rear camera pics also no flash for front camera 4 battery back up is  also good with heavy usage it will run up to 1215 hours with mild to less usage it will run more than 30 hours with average usage  it will go up to 2022 hours  main cons the main thing i did not like is the unexpected display of battery   some times after heavy use for 1012 hours it will show 75 but suddenly with in 12 more hour it will drop to 45 another 30min  25 another 30min  its switch off because of 0 battery  one night i was listening song also playing a game at the same time for around 2 hours it was already 1617 hours with average usage since i charged it last so after playing and listening song i saw 68 charge still  remaining i slept by 2am woke up by 7am and i found my phone to be dead with 0  battery like this already happened for 23 times dont know why the battey  is showing like this but battery is good compared to other smart phones  overall product is good with many latest features included
5614	Micromax Canvas Nitro A310 (Blue)	this mobile is the best out there in the market in this range produced by micromax it has almost met all the expectation of mine also i got this mobile little bit cheaper rs 10000 due to the diwali deals here are the few pros and cons listed out as experienced by me pros 1 octacore and 2gb ram so obviously no lagging while playing hd videos or playing highend games like asphalt 8 adrealinereal racingetc 2 16gb internal memory meaning you dont have to worry about installing too many applications 3 stylish and sleek design with mattefinish back cover leaving other people jealous 4 good speakers good music experience also the earphones coming along with it had the terrific music quality leaving me over whelmed  cons 1 no moving of apps from internal memorytoexternal sd card but 16 gb of internal memory and the option of storing apps additional info on external card is enough to cover it 2 also battery is not properly calibratedie battery decreases from 100 to 8090 in one day and suddenly it decreases to 10 the next day solutions are given on the net to resolve this issue  due to above two cons i missed out on 5 stars but if you dont find this two cons as a major issue then go ahead and buy it without giving it any second thought
5615	Karbonn Smart A1 Plus Champ (Dark Blue)	i gifted this to my mum who is a novice for touch screen the phone is very good every penny is worht the value pros  1 touch screen sensitivity is very good 2 there is no lagging in any manner 3 its response its far better from other mobiles in this range 4 camera of 3mp is really good 5 display of some hd photos loadedtransferred is really good  overall very pleased with the performance  cons 1 nothing so far

5621	Pocket Surfer 2G4	i bought this phone mainly for the description that said its battery has 1800mah capacity  but on buying i found the package contains only a 900mah battery this is a basic android mobile and would be useful if you are looking for a feature phone with a touchscreen interface
5622	Pocket Surfer 2G4	phone turns on off automatically initiated a return request other than that the phone is good and you cant use 1 yr free internet with the inbuilt ubisurfer because it is worst than a wap browser
5623	Micromax Canvas Blaze MT500-White	the processor is kind of basic and the os is little outdated as many other mobile companies are offering better os and processor for the similar price says product description which is very true  this thing is suitable only for basic usagesince this is priced higher than many good quadcore1gb ram devicesthis is not worth buying  those who are buying for the cdma support in this devicelet me tell youthis only supports mts sim

5647	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Shimmery White)	first of all samsung galaxy s5 successor to hugely popular galaxy s4 comes in two versions one powered by a qualcomm snapdragon 801 chipset and the other powered by adonis prime2 quad 19ghz  quad 13ghz of which later version is available in india if you have doubts check samsung india galaxy s5 page for full specs  both are very powerful chipsets and the benchmarks scores are almost identical this has 2gb of ramunlike the note 3 released earlier which had 3gb of ram throw anything at itwhether it be a full hd video or a high end gameeverything runs on this device without any issues one thing which is missing in the version available in india is lte support s5 available in india supports hspa 422mbps speeds    display and build quality the display quality is much better than its predecessor galaxy s4s display and there is a small increase in size 51 inches from 5 inches on s4  everything looks sharp and vivid on s5s super amoled screen and is said to be one of the best displays available in the market  the back of the device is now a leathery plastic giving it a less glossy appearance but giving it a better feel when holding one important feature s5 boasts is that this has an ip67 certification which means that it8217s water and dust resistant overall the looks of the device resembles older phones in the samsung galaxy line up i think its high time for samsung to improve the looks of their galaxy flagship devices look at htc one m8 for instancethe build quality is top notch and samsung is nowhere near that type of attractive looks and the built quality   camera mainrear  16mp 1268221 phase detection af sub front  20mp 1920 x 1080 wideangle lens  the camera on the s5 is as you can expect is better than the one seen on s4and offer common software features like hdr rich tone selective focus virtual tour shot 4k video recording is also supported 5 mins limitation is there  one other feature samsung boasts about the camera is the improvedfaster auto focus capabilities s5s camera is without any doubtone of the best you can get now in an android smartphonebut when comparing to s4the difference in quality is not that huge low light performance is also not that good   software this is running the latest version of the touchwiz ui on top of android 44 kitkat as you can expect the ui and the apps operation are very fast with almost no lags since this is a flagship devicethis is eligible to get future android version updates too it has features like fingerprint unlockingheart rate monitor etc   some highlights and misc features the home button now includes a capacitive fingerprint sensor a heart rate monitor next to the led flash sensors  accelerometer gyro proximity compass barometer hall rgb ambient light gesture fingerprint heart rate sensor connectivity  usb30 bluetooth 40 storage  16gb user memory  microsd slot up to 128gb  emergency mode ultra power saving mode s health quick connect private mode kids mode   battery 2800mah one is good enough to get you through one whole day of moderate usageultra power saving mode turns the screen into gray scalewith limited appswhich helps to get more juice out and can last longer   verdict  should you upgrade from galaxy s4   overall a great devicecoming with the latestand the fastest available processors and many cool software additions as you can expect the price of the device is at the high end of the spectrumand in my opinion is overpriced if you are an s4 useri think this is not a very great upgrade in terms of performance and software features many of the software features and the new touchwiz is gonna land on s4 eventually anyway for an s3 userthe lookthe performance and the camera are surely gonna be very refreshing and the overall experience would be far much enjoyable if you have enough money and for some reason dont like similarly priced newer htc one m8 or xperia z2look no where else this is the best you can get
5648	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Shimmery White)	worth at its performance s5 indial model galaxys5smg900hzwa snapdragon processor mainly supports 4g if people hate phone just because of snapdragon then they need to fight with government to bring 4g across india  compare with most other competitor i can assure you that samsung galaxy s5 will take over edge at the results for sure
5649	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Shimmery White)	some other made complaints about product but for me product is 100 genuine properly sealed by samsung so device and accessories are original of course so no need to worry about product quality shipment on time quick responsive customer service team ie live chat as well as phone call overall best experience with amazon thanks to seller vijay sales for providing me cellphone at such a lower price 348k trustworthy and of course i should not say about phone performance its amazing and product worth buying at this price

5658	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Shimmery White)	the box i got was opened so it should be a duplicate mobile or used one so i returned it purchased this mobile from retail store even though the price was higher than online price  this is a great mobile with almost everything
5659	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Shimmery White)	this another bloated overprice junk from samsung this company seriously doubts the iq level of indians we are supposed to pay more for than us  other countries  yet get a comparatively inferior version  like many previous reviews have pointed out this phone has samsung proprietary exynos octa processor which is slower than quad core snapdragon 801 in us heats up pretty quickly eats too much battery does not support lte  worst of all there is no third party developer support because samsung is too lazy to provide documentation  driver binaries for developers  build quality is same old plastic samsung is known for plus they have added flaps to make it waterproof but it is still not true waterproof phone like sony xperia z it can be called spill proof phone  camera has been improved a bit but no ois like many other phones or any innovation like htc one m8 with selective focus with dual camera lenses  size keeps getting bigger  bigger wonder when this trend of making bigger phones with so high pixel density will stop  they have added fingerprint scanner which is too a gimmick rather than necessity to justify this price tag also there is heartrate monitor dont who would be interested in this  their touchwiz has been bloated for years  it surprises me with every generation they somehow manage to find even more bloat to add to already bloated os anyone remember magazine ui in latest note series that even managed to lag on snapdragons even google was upset with that ui  they have added nsa sponsored samsung knox which may be useful for 621 of users but is irritating for rest of the 99 of users it wont let you root your phone if you like tweaking androids internals then be prepared  overall this pricing is final nail in its coffin galaxy s4 numbers were low compared to s3 now be prepared for even low numbers if you need a better phone get nexus 5 but if you need a better camera wait for htc one m8 or xperia z2
5660	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Shimmery White)	features wise its gograveod not excellent but looking wise its average

5662	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Shimmery White)	i always wanted to upgrade my samsung s3 to a s5 and waited for the price to drop a bit i got the phone for 35k and change at this price the phone is a steal it is a high quality product with an excellent auto focusing camera i have used it for around 20 days now and the phone has been running without any glitch emails and facebook synced music and videos loaded ample pictures and videos taken using the rear camera video chat used heart beat monitor and pedometer used daily etc

5676	Lenovo A850 (Black)	i had purchased leonvo mobile a850 online through amazonwith in a month i had to submit the phone to your service center in mumbai as there was an issue of phone shutting downrestart on its owneven though we requested to replace handset as it was hardly a month old they just serviced it and returned itthe problem persisted  again after using the the phone for another month the phone just went dead last month we immediately submitted the phone to your service center but we have been charged rs 4000 service chargewe were not even informed about the expected costthe phone is within the warranty period and lenovo is not honouring any of its warranty commitments  this is very unfair on part of lenovo to supply us a substandard product and then charge us for no fault of oursi am very upset with lenovo and would never recommend any product to lenovothey  have a  poor service network which is outsourced to some comopany and they do not even bother about customers
5677	Lenovo A850 (Black)	i have ordered a leanova a850 black and with in 15 days the top glass just cracked on cheaking with the service center in vadodara the wanted to keep the hand set for 2 days and said it would take about 15 days to get the replacement glass today i have come across another lady who has experienced the same for problem of top glass broken i wonder if lenova is aware of this problem dinkoo mistry
5678	Lenovo A850 (Black)	lenovo a850 is a mid range quadcore device priced around 15k  featurespros and cons  1 55 inch ips displaybut coming with a poor resolution 540 x 960 pixels  ie only 200ppi viewing angles are good  2 this is powered by a mtk 6582m quadcore 13ghz processor which performs on par with the popular mtk6589 processor the gpu on board is a mali400 mp it performs better than the usual gpu powervr sgx 544mp seen in mtk6589 devices like micromax turboxolo 3000 etcgaming performance is great for the price  note  gsmarena lists this has a powervr sgx 544mp gpu which is an error gfxbenchmark website clearly shows it has a mali400 mp   3 1 gb ram which has now become a standard in 10k devices allows lag free multitasking  4 jellybean 422  not the latestbut still new and better than 41 jellybean im not sure whether this device will ever get updates to 43 or 44 no word from lenovo yet like any other lenovo devicethis too has a modified custom uiso not a stock android experience  5 battery  lipo 2250 mah battery which is good you can get around 2 days of average use with low brightness settings  6 camera  5 mp rear and vga front cam photo quality is not good  7 storage   you cannot move or install apps to the sdcardso you are stuck with around 2 gb of internal memory for apps and games installationwhich is not enough if you plan to install a lot of games  overall a good huge device with decent specsbut priced a little higher camera quality and internal memory are the key downsides of this device
5679	Lenovo A850 (Black)	phone function is very good but camera photo quality is too much bad even other basic phone 13mp camera photos are very good
5680	Lenovo A850 (Black)	good phonebig screenfair screen qualitynice battery back upyou will not regret buying iti am enjoying using itonly camera can be improved
5681	Lenovo A850 (Black)	the sreen resolution is too low battery drains often poor appication  overall good spec for cheap price worse then micromax
5682	Lenovo A850 (Black)	superb phone for a regular use4gb internal memory so cant install huge appsgood for its budget quad core 1gb ram camera is not that great but manageable
5683	Lenovo A850 (Black)	i am happy with the phone it is very good at price of about rs 12000  it is very good value and the pros are large screen and quad core only con resolution is not very good would recommend this phone to others amazon service was very good and fast delivery
5684	Lenovo A850 (Black)	good long battery life a bit heavy better than most of the indian brandsgood buy at an affordable price and lenovo reputation
5685	Lenovo A850 (Black)	an outstanding performance and the battery life is good thanks for lenovo but we are nor getting a good quality flip  cover for the same jayesh gandhi
5686	Lenovo A850 (Black)	once you start using it update the software ie from  setting  about  check for update  and update  now you can move you most of the apps to sd card which you could not in the box version after a long research i ordered it from amazonin and added 1 day delivery and got it in time wow and on using it for 2hours i found it had no option to move the app to sd card i searched it on internet and yes it lacked that i check if there was any update from lenovo but alas it was not so i called up customer care of amazon and described the issue with them and amazingly they suggested  if i did not like or am not satisfied with the phone i can return it and get full refund i was astonished by these and finally agreed to return and then again i checked for update  yes it was there  was lucky i downloaded it and was successful to move apps to sd card and thus i am now not returning my phone i love it  go on buy it with confidence i bet you wont regret it very good fast phone
5687	Lenovo A850 (Black)	wellbought this product 4 months back working good as of now processor is okay the screen and its resolution for 10k is okaybut considering the newest releases like moto g and moto elenovo a850 can be developed and yeacamera is 5mpbut the pictures look 2mp or something camera lacks quality  ps  prefer the newest releases 
5688	Lenovo A850 (Black)	i love the phone been using it for 1 year pros good display never get stuck when playing running games i have installed temple run2 subway surfer and angry nanny all at once cons bad camera pics are good when there is enough light but still could have been better battery life is ok but not best
5689	Lenovo A850 (Black)	im using it for a month and it is really goodi do not play heavy games so i dont know how would it work especially if you are a reader of articles then the screen size will help you internet speed is very good but you have to get the latest system update to transfer app data to sd cardsettingsabout phonesystem update
5690	Lenovo A850 (Black)	good phone for the price of rs9000i have faced no issues in past one monthoverallexcellent
5691	Lenovo A850 (Black)	the real smartphone money can buy 3 days of battery backup is not a joke i been using this for now almost 20 days and it rocks in all ways this phone surely runs ahead of all phonesespecially samsungs  5 stars for lenovo  5 stars for amazon for making this deal possible  thank you amazon

5694	Lenovo A850 (Black)	what an amazing purchase this has turned out to be an year has passed and the performance has not dipped no issues whatsoever the battery backup is a bit low but then again i am a very heavy user i would recommend this phone to everyone great service by amazon
5695	Lenovo A850 (Black)	performance of phone is great awesome and screen is also nice despite of low resolution not for camera loving people as rear camera performance is equivalent to a 2 megapixel fixed focus camera dont buy if you consider camera important
5696	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	i hd ordrd it from amazon but no issue with them but got on 10th nov n brokn display on 20 novnw its 14dec but still dint get repairdslipd just n got heavy damagei feel service of xolo is waste n the product is worst bcz quality is nt at all gudi was using samsung since 4 years n the touch screen is so gud nt cheap as xolo plz dont waste ur moneyiam keeping it paid 11399 for cel n to repair its 6800 the xolo care bil taking a month to repair plz dnt buy online plz plz plz hard earnd money plz dont waste 
5697	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	xolo q2500 is a 6 inch phablet powered by a mediatek quadcore chipset and 1 gb of ram xolo devicesas always are well built with good looksthis thing is powered by a 3000mah battery that can easily last one day of heavy usagemaking it a good entertainment device the back panel of the device is matte finished giving it good grip   highlights 1 6 inch lcd screen with a resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels  ie 720p displaywith 245ppi  2 mediatek mt6582  quadcore cpu clocked at 13ghz and mali400mp2 gpu 3 1 gb ram 4 android 42 jellybean with onscreen buttons enabled  xolos official website says they will upgrade this to android 44 kitkat at a later time 5 3000mah battery 6 net firewall software integrated into the settings allowing you to control which apps can use internet  datawifi    performance the cpugpu combination on this device is quite good and many of the graphics demanding games can be played without much issues the ui is stock androidwhich makes it buttery smooth to navigate 1gb ram ensures good multitasking overall performance is great same internal specs are seen in devices like xolo q700s micromax canvas minigionee m2 etc   camera 8mp dual led bsi sensor  good enough for your sharing needs camera performs well in good light and it can also shoot 1080p videos the front camera is a 2mp one   in the box xolo is providing a free flipcovera screen guardwall chargermicro usb cableusb otg cable and normal headphones not inear  the battery is nonremovable   verdict overall a good phablet with good specs idle device if you are looking for a phablet with good battery backup xolo is also promising android kitkat update for this device and they are good at giving ota updates unlike other indian manufacturers if you want even more powercheck out gionee m2 with a 4000mah battery with almost same internal specsbut coming for a lesser price
5698	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	an above average phone features are good but xolo service is very very poor the replies they give to our complaint mails are very casual as they dont even bother to read our problems with the device the phone didnt get update to kitkat but their website still says the phone is upgradable to kitkat even after release of lollypop in motog xolo dint release kitkat update for q2500 shame
5699	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	the speaker volume is low but i love the long lasting battery gotta wait n see if this battery health of carrying on for two days lasts longer got this phone in july 2014 video n picture quality is good enough for me 634 screen provides for good reading
5700	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	good stuff for the price my motivation was good battery backup good camera and large screen but battery backup 70 of expectation runs for one complete day with all internet datawifi on and 15hrs of continuous phoning and only 20 battery to spare at the end of the day battery may go on for two days if used only for phoning and without data on or without any other use like movie or audio camera is more than average screen 100 worth good build quality free screed guard and very user friendly good quality flip cover add great satisfaction to my purchase
5701	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	nice build quality although its 6 inch phabbut its very handyamazing experience to watch moviesread booksbrowsing  camera quality  touch a bit dissapointment but overall its a nice device
5702	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	terrible mobilefrom the day i have got itit gave nothing but troublevery badly made mobilevoice is inaudiblefrequent call drops and hangs in the middle of callsdont buy it at all
5703	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	i had owned and used a xolo q800 earlier so i was expecting a better device since  i was upgrading  to xolo q 2500 my views are that only the screen size is bigger than xolo q800 or else xolo q800 was better device than this the touch screen is very sluggish and the phone hangs occasionly and the proximity sensor is not very sensetivethus many a times the call gets disconnected by itself again  the volume is also too low and the headsets provided are very cheap and unusable hence i am using sony earphones the volume control is also provided in the left side cumbersome to use with flipcover on it should have been on the right side yes the flipcover and the football which came along with it are of good quality final opinion a good device but not a very good device so xolo  not the next level
5704	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	cons    i am a nexus 4 user which i bought 1 year back for 18k from us so benchmarking this phone at a price tag of 14k i feel it is not a great value for money resolution is not very good onboard memory is just 4gb leaving the user with 1gb of usable space    the first thing you will need to do is buy a memory card because this phone doesnt have much on device memory left for the user  pros     xolo secure is okay    dual sim is very convenient to use    for first time android users looking at bigger screens and bigger fonts this is a perfect choice at this price
5705	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	i ordered a xolo mobile  got a 1 tb hard disk in the delivery box  i called them up and learned that amazon does not have a replacement policy for wrong deliveries if you get a wrong item in box you have to return  get a refund  reorder which is pathetic i was not so disturbed with getting a wrong item as it could be due to human error but at least they should have replaced it with the correct product i ordered  they took 2 days to pickup the wrong item  10 days to issue me refund my current phone was malfunctioning  i needed new phone urgently but because of their useless policy i had to wait for 15 days to get it from a different portal as my money was stuck with them  i was also scared they might accuse me of changing the product because the cost of hard disk was 13 of that of phone i request amazon to bring changes to their policies  treat wrongly delivered item returns on priority  not treat it as a normal return of a correctly delivered product
5706	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	wifi is stays no longer it is keeps on disconnected
5707	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	battery  hit at the time of charge and net useage
5708	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	did not meet my expectation
5709	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	awsum phabletsuperlyk
5710	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	good some time it hangs
5711	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	nice product i like it
5712	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	its real a good phone its amazing thank you amazon best in budget you cant forgot this phone in your life
5713	Xolo Q2500 (Black)	after a huge search and thinking i decided to buy this fone placed an order and the delivery by amazon was also nice but the problem was that as per the specification provided here on amazon and other website and on xolo too the internal memory is 4gb but the one i received had only 2gb i still wonder how this can happen but with regret need to place a return request on the same day of delivery
5714	Lava C11-S(Grey)	the details mentioned pre loaded games which it does not have my  airtel sim does not work on it display  letters too small to use the touch pad by finger touch phone restarts by it self disappointed with the phone will have to purchase most probably another one soon

5720	Micromax Unite A092 (White)	i really liked the phone good processor good speed and response no lagging most of all good memory touch sense you cant compare it with apple or samsung or htc but overall the touch is good camera is good only for the day light night time its not good best part the back panel has got a hard plastic which is a kind of a glass look it really protective too i would rate this phone 455 y people for the sake of using a phone or like buying a smartphone for the first time i would recommend this phone for first use the rate is also worth micromax good job

5781	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	got the courier before expectation was very happy but could not hold it courier looked perfect but after removing the outer plastic packing got the phone box inside which had a hole near upper left corner the box seal was broken and the phone inside was hit just below the hole luckily it was the screen guard which protected the screen from getting damaged it is clear that the seller was aware of the issue but packed it and sent to me as outer packing was not damaged  phone camera is not working perfectly it is getting blurry images and videos with hazy lines sometimes  talking about the phone it is awesome product with super value for money performance looks battery backup usability every thing is as mentioned and can beat almost all top phones in the market in performance  i will suggest to avoid this seller try somewhere else if planning for this phone i have been fooled lets see what is amazon upto for this issue i will let everyone updated  updating my review  got problem of touch screen after two month of use upper half touch screen stopped working so went to lenovo service centre on 280314 they kept the phone and returned back to me on 170414 with doa replacement certificate i asked them to make the replacement but i got shocked with their reply they said since i purchased the phone through online shopping site they wont replace the phone i have doa and the phone sealed in its box was suggested to courier it to the seller so i did it called the seller for the status after a week and got a reply that since i have made online purchase and the seller is far from me it will take time maybe 15 days to a month  friends i did this shopping since there was 10 cash back and was a good offer but what i got out of it a defective phone with very poor service for online buyers paid shipping charge to amazon then for replacement and dont know if there is some more left secondly used the phone for less than two month and the phone is roaming from me to service centre and then to the seller and dont know where is it now for more than a month i dont know when will the phone arrive to me  lesson is that i will never do the same thing again and will ask every one to avoid it one can go to any service centre of any brand and enquire for the service and doa cases for online purchased items dont go after attractive price advertisements or other things there will be no one to support after fooling you
5782	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	its been a week since i started using this mobile  it took me close to two months before i narrowed down to this model  i am happy to have purchased it  my budget was upto 20k and i had samsung micromax nokia  even nexus 4 in mind though it costs a few extra 4k still somehow i went with this model for the following reasons cool looks good configuration for this cost 12 mp camera  at a comparatively lower price  many of my friends told not to go for it as lenovo is very new to the mobile phone market still i had trust in ibm  went for it so far looks good and with its sleek design doesnt feel like carrying a big mobile of 47 inches camera clarity is really good  even in night time with led flash the quality of photos looks cool the mobile is loaded with inbuild apps of course other too do come 8gb internal memoery with an option to expand upto 32 gb with the sd card a very responsive touch  it doesnt get hanged  the only thing i couldnt feel is the fact that the battery life doesnt last beyond a day no complaints but expected to last a bit longer as it was comparatively better than other models in at least paper  overall the feel good factor is there  i would recommend this mobile for those looking within 1516k budget 
5783	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	camera is not that great  gives a performance of an 8 megapixel shooter and is somewhat more vulnerable to chromatic abbreviations  loud speaker isnt that great gives allot of distortion and the sound isnt that loud enough  since it has curved display pasting screen guard is a bit of difficult job  notification light could be much more better if it was bright enough coz this is not even that visible at night  the touch oriented buttons arent light illuminated so it might be a problem if you are using at night  call quality is average not excellent  battery charging takes little more comparing to phones of similar power and price range  get little heated at the top back side if used heavily  but overall itz a good branded phone for that price range the above mentioned are the throwbacks i felt in the hardware side except everything is fine and i would recommend it for avg users 
5784	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	i was looking for a mobile in range of 15k17k after doing too much rd online i selected this one its  been a week using this phone my review is as follows  pros 1 the display is really good touch response is quick  no lag or so  2 primary cameras photo quality is amazinggives you nice clicks in day time and more than satisfactory night photography secondary cameras performance is satisfactory 3 music quality is awesome and loudspeakers give you enough volume for a medium size room 4 gaming is superb  games like asphalt7  temple runii runs very smoothly 5 look wise phone is beautiful light weight very sleek to hold and can be operated with single hand only 6 there are many useful apps pre installed but still around 500 mb of ram is free  8 gb of internal storage as given in the specification 7 battery life is more than satisfactory lenovo power management application is there to manage the battery uses 8 gui is awesome gives you lots of options for customization  cons 1 sound quality from earphones is not up to the mark  one more thing battery is not lithium polymer as specified by lenovo rather its lithiumion   overall i would say that phone is awesomebest in its price category
5785	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	got this one for my girlfriend last month this red variant is very girly just hold it and youll know the specs at this price is remarkable the back camera is surprisingly sharp and does live up to the expectations the front camera is more than decent excellent display thanks to the 312 ppi you may observe a slight lag while playing highend games but again thats pretty normal nowadays with most smartphones that can be because of the mediatek processor overall its a perfect phone for a woman  stylish looks excellent camera decent battery and performance good enough for an average user timely delivery and excellent packaging  kudos to amazon  ps always buy goods marked 34a fulfilled34  that means its actually vetted by amazon and amazon handles all customer service and product returns for 34fulfilled by amazon34 items more importantly its reliable
5786	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	it was a first time for me buying a phone online but the prices offered were way too good to ignore i got this phone for 147 k and the market price was closer to 20k  it is a great device loaded with features and in my opinion the best product in the 15k price range been using it for over a month and have faced no issues whatsoever  the only thing that amazon can do to improve phone devices is start providing mobiles with a screen guard a screen guard is a must for all touch screen mobiles and the customers have to order them separately or go to a shop to get it fitted  to ensure no bubbles form which is likely when the customer herself does it therefore providing the customer a choice of a fitted screen guard with the phone at a slightly higher price will make the entire affair an ideal one for the customer
5787	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	its an amazing phone in its price range got all the features of a high end phone 25k30k but in a lesser price so basically its a high end phone in a lesser price recently it got updated to android 44 kitkat the performance camera screen all are good however the ui may not be liked by all since it has all the app icons distributed on the various there is no app drawer as in most of the android phones comes preloaded with security software theme center file browser etc so at the first go it doesnt require any new app from play store the red color is different from the normal blacks or whites readily available in the market if you are looking for a economical phone with features as good as a high end phone then this is a perfect choice
5788	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	pros great phone for less than 15k quad core processor  pretty fast good camera picture quality sleek light weight  stylish  good for girls  i bought for my wife  cons battery life lasts not more than a day with moderate usage it gets switched off when put for charging for longer time does not start even when pressing power button multiple times it worked only after removing the battering and putting back in place again this has happened a few times now if it continues more frequently i will have to intimate lenovo technical support about this problem
5789	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	my 5 stars for product but not a single star for seller and services because seller is cheating customers by providing 4 gb internal memory out of that only 28 gb is available amazon peoples are making fool to customers you can return your product but it was big disappointment  product is outstanding beats all the product between midrange touch is so smooth and display is crisp and clear  i recommend this product but dont buy from amazon
5790	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	i bought the white version of this phone it is the best phone available in the market in this range and rather covers all features required in smart phone camera is very good i am using it for 9 months and not hanged even once dont buy any samsung phone but go for lenovo which has good sar value also this phones features and looks are the best i just love it  now planning to buy another lenovo phone for my wife
5791	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	awesome piecei got this mobiles 8 gb variant in 13800 from amazoni am using this phone from last 5 monthsnot single issue i face with this phonequality of camera battery back up2 days for calling 1 day for surfing 23 day for using hotspot is goodit is also mistakenly dropped by me on bare floor 2 times eventhough its perfectly finerecently i get upgrade of kitkat version as advantage
5792	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	its a great phone guys ita an under rated beast superb uivery great touch response and what a camera i have tried heavy games like asphalt and temple runeverything went smooth without any lag i even took skype calls it was butter smooth  its way better than moto g and asus just go for it if you are a girl then go for the red colourits great
5793	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	i preferred it over moto gpersonal choice of course pros within 2 days homedelivery at 13500 amazon provided me best deal excellent camera sleek and stylishhas every thing that a 20k samsung phone could offer and better to go fr it then subbrands like micromax  cons battery drained in less then a day on 3g network android 42 is only available still
5794	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	good mobile good value buying  but i do not have the good experience with lenovo service  my screen broke and i paid 8500 rs to replace it that is almost 60  of the cost of phone the same screen was available at 3000 rs in gray market  i am not sure why lenovo is charging high i am not happy with charges of service center
5795	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	this phone is the most affordable branded phone in this category really cool features good lookinggood displaybut not so good camera and processor thoughhangs sometimes and gets super heated up quicklyeven during chargingbut at this price these flaws can be ignoredqualcomm processor would have done the job i guess
5796	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	its worth it got it for my wife looks on this is incredible made many heads turnhas an inbuilt power manager and an anti virus runs through a whole day of musicvideos calls and browsingmany gesture based controls performance day today and gaming is great in its segment definitely a frontrunner
5797	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	the performance is more than expected very slim and grabs attention quicklycurved scratch proof glass makes it fell sleeker over all working fine but the sound is little bit low compared to other phones
5798	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	nice phonedecent love the camera love it already chrome crashes at times plus its hard to find accessories for this phone
5799	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	excellent handset and amazon service is very good and very fast i am satisfied with amazonin i seen this handset in amazon
5800	Lenovo S820 (Red, 8GB)	awesome performance value for moneyneed to update all applications to the latest version for a faster browsingloving the overall feeltends to heat up a  bit while charging close all background apps at the time of charging to prevent excess heat battery performance is one of the best
5801	LG G3 (Silk White, 32GB)	recieved the phone in perfect condition and before the expected date the phone works considerably good the quad hd screen uses a lot more battery than i had usually thought the phone charges in approximately 100 minutes if and only if you are not using the phone for any of your little adventures else it can also take upto 5 hours to completely charge the battery which usually depends on the tasks you are trying to complete with the phone the phone lags a bit sometimes but that can be put aside considering the overall performance of the phone a good device got the lgs flip case inside the box
5802	LG G3 (Silk White, 32GB)	i got what i expected amazingly smooth device with excellent camera things that could improve is the software device crashes the home screen often an update from lg might do the trick but overall i am very much satisfied with the device
5803	LG G3 (Silk White, 32GB)	ordered it via elephant dealsreceived the product within 2 days product is really worth ur money  only drawback is battery life which lasts 1 full day
5804	LG G3 (Silk White, 32GB)	the phone is really good but the phone accessoriesear phones arent working i tried it for other mobile phones but still no luck i tried to call to the customer care to complain but had no luck the phone kept ringing but no one answered the phone is best in the market but amazons service sucks

5809	HTC Desire 210 (Black)	i bought it from qrs for 9k because online shopping wasnt available at the time and i desperately needed to replace my phone  i have used it for a year now and the only problem that ive had till now is with the camera and also the processing speed which is a bit on the slow side but i run apps like fb whatsapp writer blogger more or less altogether the best part about it was that it is reliable and sturdy i dropped it by accident from the fifth floor of my building and it fell on the side of the road  the end result was that the screen was totally cracked but the phone was stil working perfectly well i was really amazed pros relatively lightweight slim can manage multitasking good screen decent speakers mine developed problems after the fall battery life finishes only after being on wifimobile data for the whole day otherwise still can last for a day and a half cons  the camera really sucks unless you take it in bright sunlight and know to adjust the settings the front cam isnt great either the accompanying headset used to hurt my ears after half an hour on a call and one earplug got damaged just after falling from the bed it was flimsy even though the clarity was ok  overall if youre not a heavy user and want a reliable phone i suggest go for it i use a philips headset with this set and it works great

5914	Nokia Lumia 930- Black	design attractive and very beautiful its not the lightest of the phones but gives a tough feel and feels secure in hands the orange one is the best and most eye catching fits really well and stays inside my jeans pocket   screen vivid and bright colors displaysuperb resolution and ppi you can really spot the difference when compared to other andys i enjoyed watching youtubemovies everything on this beauty  outlook  office email reading environment has improved by tons so much better than stock email apps from any other android phones i have used so farhighly recommended if you use a lot of email and office  camera the best phone camera i have ever used 1020 may be better in terms of pure camera ability and zooming claritybut still i think this phones camera is much better and handy in every condition as compared to other flagships also considering the price lens is much wider allows more light and excellent low light performance great shutter speed at low light condition and you will really struggle to get blurry image from this phone  video recording is also beastly no words  wireless charging forget about fiddling around with small holes at the bottom or top of the phone wireless charging is definitely a winner a plus point  os windows 81 very easy to use os is lag free and demands less but still os needs little improvement lets see what windows 10 brings to this phonereally excited  gorilla glass gives it a tough feelsides are much smoother than it looks  affordable very affordable considering all advantages and in comparing with other flagships in every aspect i think its a beastmostly the cameraand displayand more  but still there are some issues just note these things before buying it tends to get warm easily but sometimes it stays cool even on high gaming maybe cause of certain apps battery drains fast while watching videos as it is 1080p and high ppi
5915	Nokia Lumia 930- Black	i had purchased lumia 930 black model via amazon site few weeks ago i am shocked to state that the frame of the phone gets hot upon usage within less than few minutes so much so that if i speak for more than 5 minutes it is very difficult to hold the phone in my hand due to this problem this is definitely a very big disappointment as we were eagerly waiting for this product lumia phones as a product of choice seem to be incorrect as a consequence of this i had to take this product to nokia service center and they have accepted that this is a defective product and have taken this up for servicing vide the job sheet no 227465550150314039 dated 14mar2015 i am expecting a phone call from you to get this issue fixed  sujit jagirdar
5916	Nokia Lumia 930- Black	i bought this phone and in two months suddenly the screen went black without much of use i think i was shipped a defective piece i have shown it to couple of nokia care and each one has a different version
5917	Nokia Lumia 930- Black	lumia the tagline meant for smooth performance this mobile lumia 930 from nokia meant for solid performance with windows 81 denim os which can be upgraded to windows 10 as of microsofts announcements has got 5 full hd screen with 22ghz clock speed 2gb ram for buttery smooth performance 20 mp camera with flash and front facing camera for skype calling moreover denim update gives you freedom of shooting 4k video with each frame at 8mp clarity thats a big news one sad news is there it aint got expandable memory only 32 gb internal to be used battery is not removable one so user needs to go to service centre to change it over a period of time lacks 4g connectivity which in turn results in outdated if technology moves on wireless charging is there single sim only thats also a flaw totally this promises to deliver solid performance with surprising elements but lacks few things price quiet costly as compared to competitive market

5929	Samsung Galaxy Grand Quattro GT-I8552 (Ceramic White)	samsung did not release an update for its android version its still 412  where as all other phones in this range are having 422 or more
5930	Samsung Galaxy Grand Quattro GT-I8552 (Ceramic White)	i am using the samsung quattro gti8552 mobile for over 6 months now the samsung quattro is a high performance mobile which delivers very good valueformoney spent six months ago i would have written excellent valueformoney spent but thanks to new launches and competition today it has a worthy competitor in the xperia c mobile from sony albeit at a slightly higher price  an indicator of samsung quattros high performance  vfm proposition is that perhaps it is the only mobile phone in the market which has not seen a price drop during the last 6 months this phone has not been widely advertised by samsung as it competes with many of its own models primarily the galaxy grand i9082 originally intended to be a vfm large screen  high performance samsung product to compete with domestic brands like micromax karbonn xolo and others it has already won many happy customers  for the first time user of a 4 inch size phone this phone might just be the most comfortable phone to hold and use in comparison with the bulky 53 inch phablets available in the market the samsung quattro can also be carried conveniently in a shirts top pocket i have used and tested this phone as a single sim phone and not as a dual sim phone it has a good touch screen the phone does not slow down while running multiple popular applications with a few running in the background quattros battery backup is also better than many other android phones which i have used  it also has a few negatives viz  1 it cannot playback full hd videos hd videos are of better quality for eg music videos in full hd specially when viewed on larger displays like tvs pc monitors etc 2 in spite of being equipped with a 5mp camera its still pictures come out in average quality 3 it does not support video recording in hdfull hd 19201080p and can record only in vga 640x480p hd videos are of better quality specially when viewed on larger displays like tvs pc monitors etc 4 wvga 480800 display quattros display is sharper than the display of the samsung grand duos which has the same resolution due to its slightly smaller display size but is inferior than the crisper qhd 540960 display of the sony xperia c  if your budget is 15k16k and you are ok with the aforesaid limitations go for the quattro if you can stretch your budget to 18k19k consider the sony xperia c mobile which does not have the aforesaid negatives but has only 4gb internal storage as against 8gb internal storage in the quattro i have also reviewed the xperia c mobile on the amazon india website i also suggest use of a class 10 16gb32gb sd card in either of these phones for faster video recordings faster video playback and faster execution of applications installed on the sd card
5931	Samsung Galaxy Grand Quattro GT-I8552 (Ceramic White)	34i received the product on time but the camera is not working  whenever i open the camera the phone gets hanged and turns blank i contacted amazon a week back but there has been no response if i will be receiving a refund or replacement i have to say that this is very poor service it is very frustrating to wait for 3 weeks to get a replacement or just a refund34
5932	Samsung Galaxy Grand Quattro GT-I8552 (Ceramic White)	have been using this mobile from the day it was launched and still with it never had any problem with the phone   the camera clarity is awesome the true 5 mp camera as written  allows you to play big games like legend and nfs  very good flash  size of the phone is satisfactory not soo huge   looks are good  intact with all required apps  but missing with the latest upgrade to os kitkat  lollipop  all in all a good phone to go with  4 stars
5933	Samsung Galaxy Grand Quattro GT-I8552 (Ceramic White)	phone details  the box contents include  samsung galaxy grand quattro smartphone 2000 mah battery inear earphone with earbuds 2pin charger micro usb cable quick start guide warranty card  the phone has accelerometer and digital compass but it misses the ambient light sensor and the gyro sensor  please keep in mind that this phone requires 34micro sim34 and not regular sim  pros smooth interface good battery life dual sim fm cons older version of os blot ware unnecessary apps which you cant delete low resolution display inconvenient micro sim slot 1  the phone has micro sim card slots the first sim card slot is present on the top below the camera under the micro sd card slot so that you need to remove the battery to insert the sim card this lets you expand the memory up to 32gb  shipping details  i ordered through 2 day special shipping paid inr 49 extra for that i have purchased multiple times using another prominent vendor as well they generally ship and deliver all their products within a day or two max without any additional shipping charge in that sense this is extra what you have to pay  courier details  as of now the courier company do not accept cards only cash this is very inconvenient considering if you are purchasing any high value item

5958	LG G3 D855 (Black Gold, 32GB)	im using this phone for a month now and till now its working better than i expected it to lg has really put some efforts in making this phone and for resolution freaks like me the display is heavenly amazing colours are vivid and the screen is brightest ive seen so far as far as specs go you will get it the same or even higher specs in other devices too but you wont get the screen quality that this phone has and the camera is an icing on cake it does its work so meticulously that if picture captured properly youd wonder whether you have clicked the picture with a dslr there are many such other features where this cell gets brownie points like knock code and many more battery life isnt that good but its not that bad either on moderately heavy usage you can make through the day sound quality is good rear speakers are loud and clear which i never expected from lg phones p they are the best cellphone speakers that lg has ever put in a cell   i think thats it  hope this would help you
5959	LG G3 D855 (Black Gold, 32GB)	seriously there is no point to have awesome features when you cannot use them no matter how much i try battery drains super fast i always keep my brightness low and try to minimize usage of heavy battery consumption applications as much as possible still the phone would consume the battery quickly  phone has awesome features and i would give 5 stars for that  but battery spoils the fun
5960	LG G3 D855 (Black Gold, 32GB)	was a good buy great pricing considering it being the 32gb version the best part is that this doesnt have the stupid amithab bachans signature

6005	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	warning this phone despite being a samsung galaxy s5 does not come with 4g capability i did not think it was possible for a phone as new and advanced as the s5 to not have 4g capability the first month i owned the phone i thought i wasnt getting 4g due to poor network connections then i finally looked at my friends phone an older samsung note 3 and saw he had 4g we both have the same network  then i reread the specifications now i realized why they included so much nonsense specifications such as 34b10 egsm 900mhz b13 dcs 1800mhz b14 pcs 1900mhz 3g umts b1 imt 2100mhz b2 pcs 1900mhz b5 us 850mhz cellular b8 gsm 900mhz34  have you ever read one cell phone review mentioning any of the above specifications no all they are trying to do is hide the fact that it does not contain 4g  thankfully i called amazon complained and as amazon always seems to do they saved the day by accepting a return with full refund   just fyisamsung s5 smg900h translates into no 4g you have to purchase the s5 smg900f in order to get 4g same price too i have no clue why they are selling a phone as advanced as the s5 without 4g and at the same price no less  completely mindboggling  if you hate 4g then this phone is for you 
6006	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	the phone is great but i felt cheated as the phone came used the pack opened and i have complained about it just short of sending it back to the seller  amazon did a great job of it so i love to buy things from them samsung s5 is a good phone
6007	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	i am using it from last 2 months and performance wise no mobile comes near to it my review after using 2 months  1 mobile is pocket friendly easily goes in pocket  2 1080p amloed screen and excellent viewing angle colours are very vivid and you will love to watch move coz of vivid colour and big screen 51inch  3 sound on speaker is not great  4 water proff and dust proff my mobile was is in full bucket of water for 1hour and nothing happened to it then i put it in fish tank for 30minutes and still nothing happened to it now days its rainy season and without any worry i go outside with my s5  5 camera quality is superb 16mega pixel takes excellent pictures one of the best camera among htc m8 sony z2 and lg g3many modes are in camera selective focus and hdr are very useful and many others  6 camcorder with 4k and 1080p what else anybody want from camcorder main feature are of slow motion and smooth motion i love to shoot slow motion video  7 battery life is excellent  8 wireless charging i have ordered wireless charging sview cover from samsung estoreand bought nilllkin wireless charger padstill waiting for it go for it
6008	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	slim light weight awesome camera quality people worrying about exynos processor jus go for it doesnt matter if its not snapdragon 801  it performs pretty well
6009	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	great phone with awesome display n speed  also has decent battery backup allnall good satisfying performance should have been little more cheaper 
6010	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	excellent phone and an amazing one day deliveey by amazon amazon is giving some gud competition to flipkart and has more matured mobile app great going amazon
6011	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	best phone avilable in the market  it has all features best features are water resistance with removable batteryso in future you can buy a extra battery and chamge it ur self ultra power saving mode full hd amoled dispaly 51 finger print scanner which is very fast and accurate fast autofocus 16mp camera samsung services service centers and resale value better then other  rest all features are avilable  i never want to buy a costly phone but for its features i purchased on a very low prise 40k  with 5k  coupen so now i have 2 extra headset and sview flip cover
6012	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	samsung galaxy s5 comes in two different variants 8211 one with a snapdragon 801 soc and 4g lte connectivity and the other with an exynos 5422 octa core soc so here the question comes which on is more powerful  galaxy s5 exynos beats snapdragon 801  previously also samsung launched its flagship galaxy s4 in two main variants 8211 1 gti9500 exynos 5 octa 5410 cpu 8211 quadcore 16 ghz cortexa15 and quadcore 12 ghz cortexa7 gpu 8211 powervr sgx 544mp3 2 gti9505 quad core snapdragon 600 lte though there was also a korean octa core version of galaxy s4 shve300ksl korean exynos 5 octa core lte and later samsung came up with galaxy s4 gti9506 quad core snapdragon 800 ltea but if you consider main two version of galaxy s4 according to different benchmark tests gti9505 snapdragon 600 clearly beats its octacore variant gti9500 hmp technology of exynos 5422 8211 the game changer  but scenario is different in case of galaxy s5 antutu showed galaxy s5 octacore is more powerful than the snapdragon variant in the benchmark test galaxy s5 snapdragon 801 variant scored 36000 points and exynos 5422 version beat it scoring 38500 points the reason behind this 25k lead is hmp or heterogeneous multi processing of exynos 5422 chip  the exynos 5410 processor of the galaxy s4 octa core is not able to turn his eight cores simultaneously for reasons of safety it can only use its four 16 ghz cortexa15 cores or four 12 ghz cortexa7 cores at a time according to the workload but the hmp technology allows galaxy s5 exynos 5422 to run all the eight cores of processor simultaneously during high utilization thus 4×21  4×15 ghz exynos 5422 galaxy s5 has taken a lead over 4×25 ghz snapdragon galaxy s5 especially in the cpu department  galaxy s5 snapdragon 801 vs galaxy s5 exynos 5422 octa core some more advantages of galaxy s5 exynos 5422 octa core over galaxy s5 snapdragon 801  1 galaxy s5 exynos has 133 mhz higher ram speed than the snapdragon variant800 mhz vs 933 mhz 2 exynos powered galaxy s5 is more power efficient as during low work load it can only use its little cores to save battery juice snapdragon variant does not have that option 3 another advantage of exynos variant is that exynos octa supports full uhsi speed that means it supports sd card micro sdxc uhsi pro class 10 cards read speed up to 70 mbps and write speed up to 20 mbps 4 exynos 5422 has the capability to supports hardwareassisted visualization snapdragon 801 does not have this but if you need 4g lte you may forget everything discussed above and go for galaxy s5 snapdragon variant as exynos variant does not come with lte support
6013	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	high priced phone without 4g  i bought it and thought that this premium phone from samsung will have 4g but to my utter dissapointment it does not have 4g a feature which even a 9k phone from other manufacturers have  i am a old galaxy user and thought i had a full feture phone but disappointing
6014	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	only reason i gave 4 star is cause of the metal ring around the phonesamsung should really come up with new design performance is just geart i read so many review about poor battery but i found battery to be satisfactory and finally amazing serive from amazon received in one day 128522
6015	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	bought it like 6 months ago and ive to admit this phone is far from what its price suggests it lags at times the phone gets heated up very fast  the camera is pretty cool and the touch  is good  still waiting for even 444 to arrive even though even lollipop has been released
6016	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	the best phone ever works like a dream and amazon sells it for so cheap
6017	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	nice phonejust have some problems with batteryit heats up
6018	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	i had absolutely no reason to be upset with my iphone 5 which has been serving me for almost 2 years but i decided to take the plunge because i wanted to give android a shot why did i choose samsung over htc a touchwiz it seems has improved b water proof c rs 10000 cheaper d removable battery  within 48 hours of owning the s5 i knew i wont be able to use this phone here are the chief reasons i returned it  you see samsung has tried to fill in every possible thing in the world into one phone their ambition by some distance supersedes my expectations for this feat i congratulate me this phone checks your heart rate has a great 13 megapixel camera nevermind the lag  has a finger print scanner doesnt work great  gives you 50 gb of dropbox 1 year of evernote premium free has a great back and doesnt feel plasticky has kies internet which allows you access the media on the phone provided you are connected on your macpc to the same wifi has a pretty good battery life has a wondeful screenblah blah but here is why i returned it  62 screen lag while talking on the phone with someone 62 screen goes off when you are on the phone call because the phone assumes it is against your cheek while i am sure this setting can be deselected it was burdensome for me 62 the call quality is ok it is not as good as the iphone 5 if you are sitting on your desk at work or wherever and the phones display screen faces you and you turn on the speaker the speaker sound will be muffled and tinny because 34the speaker is located on the back34 this is such a big flaw that i dont even know why samsung calls this is a finished product 62 interface options compared to iphone are tremendous but some simple things like browser not customizing itself like iphone were annoying while web surfing the iphone has spoilt me to make sure every website is accessible on my iphone with s5 there is either a learning curve or not as good browser zoom 62 the front facing camera is horrible the back facing camera has a bit of lag on auto mode i take videos of the sun when i am driving and the sun is setting sometimes while this was possible with one hand operation of iphone the experience on s5 was terrible 62 the phone wants you to have a default email address the gmail address for google play samsung account dropbox account google drive account it wants you to choose what browser it should choose it wants you to choose your texting client are you kidding me has anyone heard of the paradox of choice 62 whatsapp on iphone is 4x better 62 instagram on iphone is 3x better and more evolved especially video uploading 62 buggy music player 62 lotta bloatware 62 the location of the headphone jack is annoying speaker volume is low  the good 62 graphics are lovely lovely to hold in hand lovely to look at sometimes the back facing camera takes outstanding pictures but the video doesnt even come close to iphonethe phone has amazing software for someone who has never used an iphone they may love itbut for iphone users this phone is practically impossible to use without complaints the battery is 3000mah  that is massivethe options for software is amazingbut simple things like a resident book reader is missing and we have to go search for everything google play surprised me it is amazing super fast the options on this phone will astound you google maps on s5 was outstanding you can have utorrent on this  the bad 62 besides the point i listed above 34the good34 section  i think the phone heats bluetooth not as responsive as iphone the charging port needs to be set right becuase it has a latch on it the phone prompts many useless things the magazine is very buggy all the samsung software is not required should be showcased in a better way more customizing is neccessary  i returned to my iphone 5 and love love love it more than ever a phone made in 2012 beats this s5 hollow the overall user experience of apple is unparallel sorry samsung fantastic try buti had to return this device  amazon were lovely about it and took it most graciously
6019	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	i booked it at 9 pm in the evening and by paying just 99 rs extra i got it very next day at 1 pmyes its trueand the phone is one of best things i used till nowi m falling in love with it day by day
6020	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	i have done so much research before buying this product and saw the previous reviews on amazon india about battery issues  i now understand why this is the case  the advert is misleading as it states as per the ukus version a 25ghz but this is not the case this is 19ghz so as a result the battery gives a poor performance  it has all the other options though as per the usual s5 but the battery issue is disappointing as this is a pricey handset had to charge it everyday   i am returning it and i would not recommend this product based on this
6021	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	fantastic phone im loving it all the more i had been using note ii till now speed clarity features are awesome with recent price cut it makes it a worthy phone to own
6022	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	i buy this mobile on 31514 last month 0215 display was suddenly off i go and ask samsung authorised dealer he told to pay rs10300 for display so dont buy any one  
6023	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	this is an indian model s5 smg900h not having a quad core 25ghz snapdragon processor as they have mentioned in there description also battery drains faster when connected to a wi fi or a 3g network and the device is getting heated up after an hour of use
6024	Samsung Galaxy S5 (Charcoal Black)	it is a nice  beautiful phone but over priced the price is not justified in comparison of other makes premium phones
6025	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	am not a tech geek so just giving a plain review based on my experience  what i liked  all basic smart phone functionalities available at low price range 45 inch big screen display the navigation buttons are on the panel rather than the screen free flip cover was of good quality  what i didnt like  the back cover of the phone doesnt look  feel good all the app icons have a border on them which makes the ui look cheap touch is not very sensitive unable to change independent volume levels audio quality is not very good front camera has very low mp which is almost unusable  general  battery drain was fair am not a gamer so dint try any games  verdict  if youre planning to buy your first smart phone or a light user who just needs basic functionalities then go for it i was having nokia lumia 520 before so this phone did not satisfy me hence returned it  got micromax canvas a1 which is also launched in amazon for 65k with many offers
6026	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	1st of all i want to criticize the amazons slow delivery system  pros 1 features like quad core 45 inch screen 1gb ram latest android flipcover included these are going its way 2 the price range within which it offers 3 i found the battery not even too bad even its good comparing with others 4 processing speed is very good it scores 17305 in antutu benchmark test which is rare in this price range of mobiles 5 the headphone sound is good loudspeaker sound a bit slow  cons theres a lot of disadvantages i found 1 the screen quality like very cheap kind of 2 the plastic body doesnt look good 3 the data cable i got with it doesnt work these kind of things are really common 4 the partition they partitioned 14gb as phone storage  just 900mb for apps within which 300mb already blocked by their preinstalled apps so you got only 600650mb for installing your apps which is very very low 5 you got a lot of preinstalled junk apps which you cant uninstall there are 3 or 4 number of browsers installed in it i dont know the meaning for doing this  final line would be you can go for this phone if your budget is limited
6027	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	few important things to keep in mind when you buy a low end phone  1 battery look for a phone with decent battery life 1800mah should be a good start it will last a full day with 25 hrs of talk time and 4 hrs of screen on time   set to 2g disable gps wifi bluetooth and location sharing when not in use and set brightness to low for a better battery life   charge to 8085 and let it go below 20 before you do a recharge   dont over charge the battery to 100 only once in 15days do a 100 charge  2 screen go for a screen size above 35 with capacitive touchscreen  a 4 inch screen will be apt to play games whatsapp browse web etc look for  a minimum resolution of 480×854 pixels  3 primary camera the rear camera should be at least 5mp but insist for flash this will be handy in the night as a torch  4 secondary camera the front camera of most of the low end phones offer basic less than 12mp so dont expect much can manage an ok selfie in decent light  5 sound the speaker should be loud enough to make the ringer heard play youtube videos audible and the alarm loud check all the 3 categories ringer loudspeaker  alarm  6 ram with the new android kit kat lowering the min specs to 512mb it will be good to opt for 1gb ram for smooth video playback and gaming   android tends to slow down over time due to multiple app installs and app data install and run clean master and uninstall it once its done  7 storage at least 4gb of internal memory with sd card expandable option   delete unwanted photos and video from whatsapps received and send folder   move as much photos and videos you can to g autobackup and save your phone space   its easy to share with friends and family the pictures you choose to share your photos are safe even if you lose your handset  8 brand a reputed brand who has a service center in your city   some good brands offer android upgrade some upgrades can slow down your phone
6028	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	its good 45 inch light weight device under rs4500  the device specifications are good better performance with 13ghz mediatek quad processor and 1gb ram along kitkat os design looks mixup copy from some bestselling devices and features are quite similar to android one but with reduced front camera and battery units and also reduced price to reach most people device supports 1 mini  1 micro sim  cons  low 1600mah battery needed at least 2000mah battery for long lasting usage  03mp front facing camera needed at least 2mp camera for video calling  5mp camera is not upto mark  mostly not included gpu for gaming  mostly no future software upgradeupdate which is reason for success of android one  service is disgusting if your device gets defective you should wait for 2 months to get repaired  so gamers and selfies be away from this device its just a basic device for low user  i recommend keep 2k more and go for better android one devicemicromaxx canvas a1  kindly click helpful if you agree and so that customers beaware before buying and also karbonn notice and improve which featured should provide on board
6029	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	very poor quality phone and miserable service from karbonn i have been unable to use it for last two months post purchase due to issue with this phone this is the fourth time i have given it for repair and the service quality is horrible the response time is equally bad the mobile shows full signal strength but can not make any call or receive any call i would have expected from any decent manufacturer to take some prompt action when a mobile has to be given for repair four times for same issue this shows a complete lack of customer satisfaction and client delight
6030	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	i had bought karbonn titanium s20 mobile phone on 10th oct 2014 and received the product within a weeks time the phone worked satisfactorily till end of march 3015 suddenly it developed a snag and the battery was not getting charged since it was within the warranted period of one year i wanted to get the phone serviced at any karbonn authorized service centre i referred to the list furnished in the warrantee card and tried to call the service centers in bangalorein most of the cases i got a message to check the number i have dialed or stated that the telephone no did not exist or there was no response finally abn communications in bangalore responded and replied that they have stopped servicing karbonn mobile phones but still the abn communications is listed as authorised service centre finally i decided to get the phone serviced by paying the charges the service centre that i contacted informed me that the required spare part is not available now the phone has become totally useless within 7 months from the date of purchase  i am utterly disappointed with the post sale service provided by karbonn mobile now either karbonn mobile customer cares address or contact no is not available in the warrantee card to contact them could you please contact karbonn mobile and get me the contact details of their authorised service centre who could service the telephone otherwise you will have to arrange for a replacement of phone or refund regards bs keshavamurthy
6031	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	everything is quite good except the sound quality is very poor you will not know when your phone is ringing in your pocket even the vibration will do no good if you are walking the picture quality while browsing the internet or watching online youtube videos is also very poor rest everything is fine according to me
6032	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	best phone below 4500 you cant get better performance at this price point  pros good solid performance with quad core processor and 1 gb of ram have tried many games like temple run 2 despicable me and they all run flawlessly  internal storage of 4gb 22gb free for apps helps in storing apps like facebook whatsapp easily  very smooth ui much better than micromax  android kitkat again rare at this price point 3g connectivity and gps bundled flip cover is great the phone came with screen guard preapplied  cons average battery i am not complaining but could have been better average screen the resolution and viewing angles could have been better but dont expect much at this price
6033	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	its a good mobile for this cost here are the truthful ratings for this mobile pros 1touch is smooth 2gaming apps like plants vs zombies and real racing 3 work fine  3both sims can work on 3g even the sim 2 4light weight and great display 5back camera is really good and hdr yields really good quality pics cons 1 gets heated up soon when the above mentioned games are played 2sound is low even at full volume its not that loud 3pre installed apps eat up most if the internal storage and those cannot be un installed 4front camera is badits just vga  otherwise its a great mobile for 5k the battery life is normal as any other smart phone
6034	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	the phone is for just showing  the model copied from apple phoneif any one want to throw money to fire then purchase it except the 1gb ram  13 qd core processor nothing is good as below picture quality is very poor and on 60 degree angle you could not see anything just see the negative photo image sound quality is very worst like 40 rupees video game and also up  down playing you can install only 4 to 6 apps  after it the memory get full battery is draining so fast with the earphone is is good not to listen camera is not good as other phones having 5mp camera overall the phone is not good as promoted
6035	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	this phone has two cons  1 loud speaker and headphones sucks  2 battery drains 5 per hour in idle and for normal use 10 per hour u must have a power bank in ur pocket if this phone is urs  other than these two cons there is no other flaw one could find in this price range camera is below average phone back panel looks cheap ui is not attractive but could live with that  pros no lags no hangs wifi bt 3g works fine with  great spread even 2g signal is not bad for browsing  go for this phone if u r 1not a music enthusiast 2 not a gamer 3 new to android
6036	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	after using it for a month i am writing the detailed experience pros 1  quadband feature though it is not mentioned in the specs 2  decent battery life 3  very responsive to touch 4  decent audio quality even in noisy environment  cons 1  greatest disadvantage  only 1gb of app phone memory most of the memory is consumed by preinstalled apps which cannot be uninstalled without rooting this also limits the number of applications you install if you root the phone then it is possible to expand fake the phone memory make a choice for this before buying this phone
6037	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	i brought 2 phone 1 is not working  flash light issue its start any member when u pick up phone the camara light start  technical issue
6038	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	below 5000 rs it is average phone front camera na hi k baraber hai audio is very less outdoor mae jab call receive kerte hai to bahut kam aawaj aata h audio system is mobile ka bahut hi poor hai either in simple or in headphone 1 baat or mobile hang v kerta h videos dekhne k liye thik h 45 screen or look accha h battery backup is also not good hamesha charging me hi laga rehta hai mere taraf se 2 star
6039	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	volume isnt upto the markwhether its loudspeaker or just calleven when set to the loudest limit the volume doesnt impress cant hear the phone ringing when kept at distance at home phone build quality not greatwouldnt mind spending another 2k and opting for another micromax canvas a1 overall not happy with this phonealthough the cost is v low the product doesnt make you feel happy to be a owner of it coz of its shortfalls
6040	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	never ever buy karbon smart phones i bought karbon smart phone a35 and found what  the obvious features such as touch keyboard is worst i am typing a and it is showing me s what a joke sound is also worst mind you this is smartphone which has original price tag of rs 6000 and with discount i got it at rs 5400  worst worst never buy also to fulfill my desire of becoming unhappy customercustomer service is also worst
6041	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	great features at a budget perfect choice for first time android users the package comes with a flip cover and screen guard placed on the screen yes with a complimentary screen guard already placed on the phone at this price amazons timely delivery as promised a handset with all you need from a phone and complimentary stuff does make it a must have for anyone looking for a complete and satisfied android experience
6042	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	nice phone at this price range and amazons service is also not bad got the phone delivered in 3 days my experience in a day will update it later pros  45 inch screen nice touch experience nice performance 2gb space available comes with flip cover light weight android 44 kitkat but speaker is not laudly sound  i brought  this phone  is not working flash light issue technical issue
6043	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	cheap and has features for smart phone sorry its a smarttoy ideal for games browsing etc only 2 draw backs 1 the voice is very week the dial tone when rings is difficult to hear unless its silence at home and u r in same room 2 you have to charge your battery every day  yes everyday   so its more like cooking range good for everything else except cooking
6044	Karbonn Titanium S20 (Black)	internal memory is shown as 4gb but it is given only 089 really as internal memory which is also most of the part is filled with some useless preinstalled apps which is also protected by phone so cant be deleted in this part is deviation from shown specs but other is karbonn quality can not be compared with better brands like camera quality is not as good as specs says
6045	LG H818N G4 GENUINE LEATHER BROWN	i am using it from last 10 days some pros 1 quantam screen is very good it looks like amoled screen outdoor visibility is excellent you can view in direct sunlight without an issue 2 dual sim st flagship with dual sim thanks lg for providing dual sim in india both are 4g but u can use 4g data of one sime at a time 3camera is mindblowing like dslr it cant replace dslr but it as good as dslr 4speaker quality is loud and clear 5 solid build i love my g4 cons 1 quad beat headphone are not so good they are better than samsung and sony headphone but not the best 2 battery is good but not stealer it can lst for 1day easily
6046	LG H818N G4 GENUINE LEATHER BROWN	lg g4  it has everything  spec bump screen quality bump battery back up and optimization so called optimization its a marketing term android is still lacking at optimization and ironing os if you want future proof device lg g4 is your choice i know everybody thinking about finger print scanner  but its completely useful with android m os by that time android m available to all the devices 2015 devices will be outdated trust me android devices will be outdated easily and quickly  always check only purchased reviews i have purchased from lg dealer find best deal and get this beast
6047	LG H818N G4 GENUINE LEATHER BROWN	got this one from lg brandstore the leather black edition its is pleasure to hold this device the display is stunning  2k  i had note4 but this one overcomes the size and features the battery is comparable to note4 no complaints in performance as well got it on 9th june in prebooking phase i was planning for s6 but this one is just so amazing to be owner of photos are amazing android 51 is running phenomenal on this device not a single crash found in last 11 days overall excellent buy i would recommend this to anyone looking for powerpacked performance within 50k
6048	LG H818N G4 GENUINE LEATHER BROWN	this is a phone with some very good features i expect more innovative technology from lg  processor and display it8217s a fast phone thanks to its fast 64bit snapdragon 808 processor opening of even larger apps is fast and smooth resolution of 2560x1440 is incredible for a sharp 558221 quad hd ips displaythe sharp images with natural looking colors looks awesome but similar screen is already available in number of smartphones and i think this feature has reached saturation as far as screen is concerned  camera the rear camera is 16mp with optical image stabilization with sharp image quality it uses laser focus feature of lg g3 for better focusing highres 8mp front camera can take good and sharp selfies it can take video at 4k resolution with very realistic colors  storage it has got expandable storage feature cloud storage is not a very useful feature in indian context where internet speed and accessibility is still limited compared to western countries so i love this feature in a smartphone the lg g4 comes with 32gb of built in memory and it can be expanded up to whooping 2tb terabytes the only problem is that 2tb microsd card is not available in the market  battery the battery is removable with capacity of 3000mah which i think fall short of my expectations from a lgs flagship device i expected wireless charging feature which is missing from this device you can remove battery to restart phone in rare event of freezing of phonewhich is unlikely with this mobile you can also carry an extra battery rather than a power bank for backups i personally like this feature  some other features  android lollipop version slightly curved design with leather finish loud speaker interchangeable back covers screen tap to wakesleep builtin in battery monitor camera support voice commands etc  only thing i didnt like in this phone is location of speakerlocated at the back  in short its a high level smartphone with fast processor awesome screen and amazing camera price of the phone is competitive compared to others
6049	LG H818N G4 GENUINE LEATHER BROWN	beautifully created smartphone by lg superb camera and fast processer 808 nothing any lags and no heating prob during charging love it my g g4
6050	LG H818N G4 GENUINE LEATHER BROWN	none of the reviews are verified seems fake will believe in its performance when its 6 months out over in the market
6051	HTC Desire 310 Dual Sim (Arctic White)	htc is back in the budget entry level market again with the newdual simquadcore desire 310  display  480 x 854 pixels 45 inches 218 ppi pixel density android version  422 jelly bean  this is the first handset from htc to be powered by a cheaper mediatek chipset  mtk6582m quadcore processor the same chipset is seen in many other devices like xolo q700s micromax canvas turbo mini micromax a114 etc the processor on board is powerful enough to power up apps and games without much issues there is one big issue though with desire 310  this only has 512mb ram while almost all other mediatek powered devices at this price have 1gb ram this is really disappointing  htc was kind enough to include their blinkfeed software in this devicewhich is missing in many other desire devices priced higher since this is a mediatek devicethe ui is a stock android oneinstead of the one you usually see in almost all htc devicesso in shortthe ui looks like any other device from xolokarbonnmicromax etcapart from the blinkfeed on the homescreen and the on screen buttons this has a 2000mah batterygood enough to get you through a day on a single charge   some notable issues cannot move apps to the sdcard so you are stuck with around 2gb of internal storage for apps and games camera is a fixed focus 5mp one which means you cant always get the object you wanna focus in focus touch to focus is also not functional  verdict  fixed focus camera and 512mb ram are the two major issues for me if brand is not that importanti would very much recommend getting some other quadcore1gb ram devices at this price range in branded devices sony xperia e1 is the closest competitor
6052	HTC Desire 310 Dual Sim (Arctic White)	bought the product during the univercell mixup so cant complain about the price but for the price listed as mrp there are many better options available 512 mb ram and camera with noautofocus are major pitfalls looks very nice and stylish htc brand name wins the trust but the specs otherwise are mediocre i would advise you to stay away if you are looking to buy it for anything more than 56k

6071	Huawei Ascend G750 (White)	before i set off to select this product i had a list of what specifications i wanted it had to be a quad core or octacore processor atleast 2 gb ram and atleast 3000 mah battery in a and a dual sim phone with 555 inch screen my budget was 1525 thousand this phone is possible the best available for these specifications at this price selection done my initial few days with this phone has been a breeze only suggestion please start it for the 1st time where you have good wifi connection battery life is excellent i dont need to carry a charger in my pocket anymore it will easily last you a day 621416 hours with heavy usage i had read somewhere regarding concerns about its audio trust me the dts is fabulous the sound quality isnt loud but clarity is great the screen isnt a corning gorilla glass but resolution is great for an optimized hd experience the sony bsi camera is ok possibly the only thing in this phone which i found could have been better but it still is problably the best available in this price range initially had a few issues with lag in seeing the details of the number clicked on a name in the addressbook but on upgrading the os available online for free download this issue seems resolved if you want a high performance phone and value your money go for it if showing off your branded phone is what you want and you are more than willing to spend for it go for a samsung or iphone this phone from  it is the largest telecommunications equipment maker in the world is the best dual sim phone which fits into the value for money buy category

6076	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	its an awesome phone i had been using android phones for last 3 years but the joy of using this one is uncomparable i purchased it in september 15 months ago review is after heavy usage  a i dont have to worry about the battery it comes one full working day am a very heavy user average 23 hours of concalls per dayusing mails on phone constantlyon twitter 247 b the interface requires some getting used to but is very clean c angry birdstemple runasphalt etc are nice no lag whatsoever d i dropped the phone accidentally 34 times over the floor no damage wahtsover e speaker phone is extremely good f touch screen is as good as it can be g ms office is awesome i can edit excel sheets with ease navigate through the outlook as good as i can on my lappie did not miss my laptop while travelling on a vacation ofcourse family was unhappy p h only drawback camera is not good very basic buy another phone only if you want a good camera or loads of dirty interface apps   update after 35 months of use  am still loving it  a i dropped the phone a dozen times on the floor by mistake of course and on one occassion broke the screen and replaced the lcd from a local service centre costed be 25k vs 45k from a nokia care b continuing to love the speed of emails c twitter and some apps have slightly slowed down and there is a slight lag wondering if this is because i have not inserted a sd card yet and there is already whole loads of data on the phone memory will clean up the phone or install a memory card and update in next 12 weeks d voice and clarity continues to be awesome e most apps working well and crisp  again the phone is not exciting its a stable functionaldependable phone for the now minority budget conscious folks out there

6084	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	its a great phone and value for money if you are looking for alternatives other than android phones in this price range then go for this  pros 1 comes with cortona even though it is not enabled for india it can be enabled by changing some settings 2 performace is not bad for the price tag 3 good display 4 battery life is good 6 there is no proximity sensors but other features of the phone makes up for it ex when on call if you touch the screen other than the buttons display is switched of this is great considering there is no proximity sensor  cons 1 poor display in outdoor condition 2 no flash 3 usb cable is not provided in the box
6085	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	it requires micro card was not aware phone processor speed is very good compared to android phones in same budgetphone has very good battery ram is less but not facing any issues like hang or else overall happy with the purchase
6086	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	just an amazing phone its crisp display smoothness of touch and the overall feel makes this product worth possessing people might complain lack of applications compared with android but who cares the overall experience is what matters
6087	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	best vfm mobile currently available in the marketusing it for the last 7 months pros 1top notch 5mp snapper for the priceway better than all micromax 8mp cams and some samsung 58mp shooters noone can beat nokia in this segment 2crystal clear audio output 3spectacular call quality 4very good build quality 5absolutely no lag at all cons 1menu and back buttons are inside the screen 2 no backlit for inscreen buttons 3absence of frontcam and led flashacceptable for the price 4bundled accessories are lessmay be to cut costs

6089	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	this was meant for my 65year old mother who had never used a touchscreen im not a fan of wp but the interface seemed to be right for old folks and it is after a little setup she is able to quite easily handle the phone and has put it to much better use than the n85 i handed down earlier  screen is much better than almost any phone under 10k the speaker is loud and clear and the camera even without a flash takes surprisingly good pictures when the light allows im actually quite happy with the purchase especially since i had very modest expectations
6090	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	pros 1 price  comes pretty cheap 2 build looks solid 3 runs windows phone 81 seamlessly  smoothly without any problems  cons  1 lack of the camera button on the side causes accessibility issues around enabling the camera 2 the camera is again not that very great 3 this is more of a personal preference but the orange colored back cover is not exactly glossy so some people might not like it  overall  nokia lumia 630 is a very nice package totally worth the money you pay for
6091	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	got this phone after much thought over the efficiency of its 512kb ram but am extremely happy with its performance out of the box i also perceive the call quality on lumia phones we also have a 525 in the family to somehow be much better than the nexus4  blackberry curve iphone 5s  that we use not sure if anyone else has perceived it too as its never highlighted in reviews  i believe the lumia 630 single sim is super value for money when compared to what else is available at the price point 7500
6092	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	i lost myy fav lumia 520 on16th mar and after some searching on17th ordered the 630 it arrived on 19th nicely packed and cod  main diff now i can trxfr things to sd card n screen bit larger microsoft ac helped get my all data back its amazing battery much better than 520 and all there for rs 5555 windows phone is a treat to or fingers nokia store has no non sense apps etc just grab one lumia n experience windows i also use android tab n ipad mini so u may trust me
6093	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	when compared with android and ios the windows apps are not upgraded and not so efficient very few apps are available in market and the nicer versions are paid the main drawback for this mobile is no flashlight no front cam and no ear phones  positives are it doesnt hang even you install so many apps its the best product for office purpose but not for entertainment superb battery life it lasts for 2 days when you use normally with whatsapp and phone
6094	Nokia Lumia 630 (Single SIM, Black)	an entry level smartphone from microsoft that feels anything but entry level a must buy for its simplicity functionality all at a humble price  buying tip compare phones based on specs to shortlistnarrow down your options then physically usetest the shortlisted phones and buy the one that you are most comfortable with please do not buy based on spec comparison only as each phone provides its own unique experience which is different for all users

6138	Xolo Q1010i (White)	ive been using the phone for 2 weeks now its worth the price for the camera alone the sony sensor makes for great shots even in low light conditions i havent been too  happy with the kitkat update though many of my installed apps have become unstable since upgrading maps crashes every time i use it now and they replaced the google swipe input with the stock android keyboard i would suggest sticking with jellybean on this phone also the battery life is not as good as i hoped it would be but all this aside i have absolutely no regrets about picking up this phone
6139	Xolo Q1010i (White)	ordered on 5th sep about 2 pm received item by 6th sep 1 pmexcellent work by amazon and the seller but didnt received any football as mentioned by the seller  about the product xolo q1010i is awesome android 442 out of the boxbutter smoothcamera is greatsound is awesome from speakers but the headphones quality is bad sound is not goodaverage batterygames are running smooth thanks to mali 400mp2 gpu clocked at 500mhz and 13 ghz mt6582 quad core cpu overall a good product at this price rangei think this is the best in all xolo mobiles

6141	Xolo Q1010i (White)	everything on the phone is mind blowing except there is 1 issue and 1 con about this device i face first of all battery performance is not good at all being 2250mah polimer battery it should give atleast 1day full usage but it last 14 hours after a bit more than normal usage and the con is despite having 8gb internal you can only use 19gb for app and 438gb for data you are not getting the total space together thats very bad
6142	Xolo Q1010i (White)	really amazing mobile  reasonable price with the features like an international brand mobile i have been using over 8months with no problem amazing display  mainly the camera is outstanding like awesome crispy pictures really amazing just go for this n m sorry to mention about amazonin services it has given a no of deliveries not only mobiles trimmers micro sd cards etc their services are mind blowing superb thankz to amazon 
6143	Xolo Q1010i (White)	i have been using this phone from past 6 months its been fantastic so far i do play high end games like asphalt 8 death trigger  that itself shows the power of this phone i bought it it for 105k that time its worth of every penny good for music n taking pics phone looks very stylish and sleek also its just 79mm thin  cons gets heated little when ur playing high end games i do suggest to go for xolo 3000 for playing such games
6144	Xolo Q1010i (White)	hello i dont think that xolo q1010i looks like as shown in photos here is it genuine productwhether product id is wrong or photos are wrong
6145	Xolo Q1010i (White)	its the best low budget phone available in market with best features and the bestest camera with sony exmor sensor the 8mp camera is really up to the mark and its front camera is even better than some of the high end phones and relatively equal to the quality of the high end costlier phones of lumia galaxy htc lg and many such other its smooth in its functioning and have decent battery keep it up xolo

6153	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	fast and safe shipping product as expected the latest windows phone 81 update will make it more interesting if you are looking for a budget windows phone go for nokia lumia 525
6154	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	its awesome phone good battery nice n cirsp images funky color body i love nokia nd the style they introduced was copied by iphone 5c
6155	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	nokia windows phone is not too bad yes it looks similar to our laptop or pc and gives us same feelings  in the price band its worth buying this phone
6156	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	performance is good and you feel good to have in hand however battery life is not impressive doesnt last for a day at least even though you dont run more applications
6157	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	performance is good with the 1gb ram but battery drains fast battery not even lasting for one day on normal use
6158	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	most third class smart phone i have ever seen 1 camera switch is not working properly 2 touch is not working sometime 3 nokia care will not entertain with any problem what you have bought from amazon 4 dont buy this phone it  is waste of money
6159	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	its been more than 2 week and i havnt experience any lagging or issue with nokia l525 its a great phone camera quality is fine it got 1gb ram so go on gamers no lagging while playing or switching btw apps  100 recommended
6160	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	i already decided to buy lumia even though many of us criticised in many ways about it prominent reason i never like android after searching various models  comparing with others product and calculating my needs i stamped on lumia 525 the first thing about phone is its very handy best to operate with fingers reaching all corners and last thing is it works very smoothly between this all is there having 1 gb ram is good enough for carrying all work load for this lumia new software release denim gives us more attractive functions and easy access from anywhere in system uploading  downloading gets easier people may have their choices but i think i got my best lumia
6161	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	this phone could have been better with a flash and in built support for all video files 10 times better than android phones which lag no matter how high priced and hardware loaded they are the software of this phone has sone glitches in explorer when watching videos online screen goes blank and explorer crashes but there are other options to it 4 star because cortana does not do as great job as expected i thought it would be like jarvis from ironman but thats not a real thing cortana will get there in few years i hope
6162	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	the product has got a lot of software problems and not upto the mark i will never buy it online again even the battery back up is not satisfactory kindly replace it
6163	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	awesome  phone for the price never had any lag running smoothly and the touch screen is awesome impressive features like autobrightness a fine camera the smart cam  app is a good one one negative is the battery its drains out quickly when using internet
6164	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	bought it for my mom  pros  easy to use excellent battery backup good performance average camera  cons  no flash 3g network is dropping on bsnl connection automatically switching to 2g
6165	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	nice windows phone for starters came from motog but 525 looks better nice and fluid with 81 update you can do almost everything as in android it made the phone user friendly overall cool budget phone
6166	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	the overall look and feel of this phone is good1 gb ram provides really good performanceonly issue is the batterydrains really fast even in normal usemay be help of a power bank can solve the problem
6167	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	lumia 525 is surely an awesome productit provides such a stable os that i really loved using it than an android phone nokia music app is too good if u r a music lover it provides u fast n free access to any music and ya the 5mp camera is really worth the pricei suggest go for nokia lumia phones if u prefer long term use n stable osofcourse battery back up too met my expectations
6168	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	its performence is goodwe can download many apps from windows storeprovides value for our moneyone need not suspect anything about this
6169	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	sexy device for its price poor battery though tad bit pricier than the new moto e but better cam than moto so over all great entry phone
6170	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	back shell was feel like cheap made material compared to lumia 520 and 525 store version in store retail version there is a punched mark of nokia logo on plastic shell but the one i bought from online is a painted logo of nokia rather than original punched type logo  but it doesnt matter the phone is cool enough for me and i am giving five star for windows phone big fan
6171	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	got this product 8532 the best price in all online stores many people written about the features of the product so not required to repeat
6172	Nokia Lumia 525 (White)	wats app is problematic with lumia 525 sound effects are not gud remaining other features are gud samsung duos is better for the same price
6173	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	gionee p3 is a budget android smartphone powered with a mediatek 6582m quadcore processor   pros  good processor   mtk6582m is a very good performer and at this price this is great android 42 jellybean accelerometer magnetic light and proximity sensors users can install or move apps on to the sdcard   cons  bad viewing angles no otg support 512 mb ram only battery 1700mah battery can only last a day of moderate use if you are a heavy user this cant even last a day  gaming performance is great thanks to the quality processor it has but the problem is many high end games may crash due to less ram available also the viewing angles are not good which hinders gaming esp those games where you tilt the screen to perform actions  the camera quality is quite good for the priceit can record 1080p videos  overall a good budget device with a few issues here and there if this had 1gb of ramthis could have been considered as a good budget device
6174	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	it is one of the best budget phones for mebought it from a local store in july 2014  it is giving me fantastic service still now my frndz who bought samsung phones of similar price complains about hangingbut this has not dissapointed me pros good battery life decent picture quality for rear camera 512 mb ram is efficient cons after rebooting my home screen apps dissapear and i have to add them again in my home screenhence the 4 stars
6175	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	touch is sensitive and faster than other mobiles because it having quad core processor camera is really good but front camera is little poor having vga
6176	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	i wanted a phone that would look good have a decent camera and not heavy on my pocket camera if you are somebody who wants a camera for uploading photos to facebook  this eould br more than enough the pictures are  of decent quality using it for 3 weeks now  appearance external appearance is not in any way lesser than the branded ones  browsing as long as you are using it for android applications it works like a dream  but the moment you try for extensive web surfing the 512 mb ram problem shows insufficient ram but again for a price this low this phone works excellently  battery lasts for a decent duration  no complaints  verdict best phone in this price range
6177	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	look ok performance good with few applications with more application speed decreses battery backup quite good signal strength  good  over all ok you just put a memory card to be insertedatleast 2 gb and make sure all setting will be in favor of card and your phone will work like charm
6178	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	i am over all satisfied with the phone but totally dissatisfied with the service of amazon who delivered me a black phone against a white order
6179	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	its a good phone with less cost but i got black color instead of white but still worth buying this phone at amazon
6180	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	low ram  as well as bad phone life got hang after 6months of use its just waste of money front camera is not good buy any other good company phone
6181	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	phone is really goodhave problem with batteryit only sustained for 56 hour if use internetbut it is ok with this price rangetouch screen is good
6182	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	it is a supper fast fone camera and battery is very goodprocessor is too goodits display is best at this price in market its price is 65006100
6183	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	you wont get a quad core smartphone at this price  gionee is a good company and now has has many service centres in india this solves the trust problem that people like me had  the battery is not great enough for this battery consuming processor thats under its hood overall a value for money phone i am planning to buy
6184	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	by mistake supplier supply me black p3 but its ok i love it
6185	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	so good no complaints very good and smooth phone 
6186	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	pros  bright beautiful screen with vivid colours excellent sunlight readability  very good build quality and decent looks perceivably better if not equal to samsungs and host of other indochina brands  very good autofocus rear camera captures crisp clear sharp images n videos with natural colour reproduction even low light captures are better than s duos 2  comes with fast quad core processor all sensors pretty decent touch very good call quality very low sar rating  accessories include silicon back cover 2 scratch guards and data cablecumcharger  runs most running driving jumping graphic intensive games without lags  cons  not so great viewing angle specially from top  headphones pretty average sound from phone speaker is decent not great  ram being 512 cant expect very highend type performance  battery backup could have been better but still acceptable  front cam is just average  reputed china brand supported by an indian franchisee service commitment level is untested though they have very big network of white label service centres  summary if youre interested in buying a smartphone with a good build quality very good camera more than decent performance and are ready to accept a slightly chunky device with minor quirks at a budget pricepoint then go for it  keep in mind that level of overall device sophistication is much better than indochina brands but probably a notch lesser than a samsung priced twice that of this device
6187	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	very nice budget mobile
6188	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	so far so good
6189	Gionee Pioneer P3 (White)	goodthe battery backup and ram is very lowso cant to get 24 hr in ma handexpecially front camera very poor when night

6257	ZTE Grand X Quad Lite V967S (Blue)	the mobile device seems to be good one and reasonably priced  zte is a reputed chinese brand that has its global footprint in telecom equipments in fact my first wifi modem supplied by bsnl was a zte make and it worked fine in fact is still working  that way this brand though not very familiar in mobile devices is a old work horse where telecommunications is concerned  this device sports 8 mp camera as well as quad core processor  although the hardware is not spectacular but considering the cost it is more than adequate  my only grouse is that this same phone is available for less than six thousand on other shopping sites overall a good phone to have
6258	ZTE Grand X Quad Lite V967S (Blue)	hi i purchased this phone about a month before the product found to be good meeting all my expectations of functions the initial worry of in common name went off as timetime passed  soft touch is good battery life is good screen appearance is good but the phones volume is low with the ear plugs another area of improvement is the phone is not on kitkat i am still in search of automatic update of software the internal memory is only 4gb

6263	Xolo Q700s (Black)	this is absolute junk it started giving me problems after just 1 month the phone switchs off itself even if you place it on a table you should place it very very gently if you are driving and you move over a bump the phone is dead again you have to switch it on battery backup is ok camera performance etc are good but with the problem of switching off automatically there is no use of other features as you cannot use them gave it to service center for repaid the problem still exists and occurs randomly
6264	Xolo Q700s (Black)	the phone is quite awesomewith great configurationthe processor is quite enough good but its only drawback is poor battery backup
6265	Xolo Q700s (Black)	it was delivered within the time they promised but i got a white model when i had ordered for black overall the product quality is good and gives value for the money

6273	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	its a good phone by samsung in a budget category getting 43 screen with 1 gb ram is very good combination  however the body is made by cheap material the screen resolution is not good compare to moto g and off course camera quality is average  if anyone wants budget phone with good configuration then go for galaxy core
6274	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	i have purchased this phone after research of phones in market i found it is a good choice after using it for one month i can get good battery backup after setting inbuilt battery saving function i got 2 days battery backup for my average use screen quality is decent and the sound quality too i like the quality of  sound through headphone its amazing no lags in general games like subway surfers temple run2 etc if battery saving is off battery saving mode reduces game performance overall its a good choice over sony xperia m  lg l7 ii dual p715 i think its worth to buy because of good display ram 1gb internal memory 8gb and good performance
6275	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	this item working good but dont keep battery power  maximum power 5 hrs thats all then low battery   this mobile poor power storage
6276	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	i m frequent purchaser from amozon as frequent as 10 items in a month but i am very much unhappy  with the amazon sellers who are selling the phone to us they are manipulating the phones or selling defective goods to the customers its a serious issue people gets attracted to the fascinating rates but at the end suffers after purchase  i have second experience as my this phone screen was gone only in 15 days of use same with my nokia 105 within 15 days its not at all working or getting on  amzon have to work for customer satisfaction and find the proper sourcing
6277	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	warranty certificate  packing material list yet not receivedoperating manual also not receivedkindaly send it as soon as possibleso i utilise it
6278	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	processing is slow after installing few more app its become slow camera quality is good a a a a a
6279	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	price of this product samsung galaxy core gti8262 in this site is bit high compare to other site this should revise by this site
6280	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	battery issues   gets switched off doesnt get charged properly etcetc otherwise ok performance dont buy from next online very poor after sales response
6281	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	ordered for my mom who was upgrading from a basic to a smartphone compared prices in all local stores  online  amazon offered the best price the order arrived in 2 days  good phone mom is very happy with the performance and wouldnt part with it
6282	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	samsung galaxy core is a budget 1gb ram device from samsung released in june 2013 it was a decent device when it was launchedbut nowfor the price you can get far better devices  display  480 x 800 pixels 43 inches ie only 217 ppi the screen brightness is not that greatwhich means it is very difficult to see the screen under sunlight the viewing angles are goodthere is also no light sensor which means auto brightness feature is not there  processor  dualcore 12 ghz cortexa5 processor this is no powerhouse good enough for your day to day tasksbut lags behind the quadcore processors coming with similarly priced devices like canvas magnus turbo minixolo q series moto g etc  antutu benchmark  7470  for a comparison to show how low the performance is xolo q700 scores  13000 micromax turbo mini  17000   camera  5 mp  the image quality is not that great it cant even record 720p hd videos while even many under rs 8000 devices are able to  operating system  samsung touchwizui on top of old android 41 jellybean  battery  1800mah this is not good enough to take you through one day of moderate use with internet on cheaper xolo q700 priced at rs 8500 ships with a 2400mah one is to be noted  verdict  galaxy core is not a value for money device in my opinion as many other devices coming at this price ships with far better performing components and newer android version buy this only if you want a branded budget device and are ok with the issues it comes with
6283	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	the delivery of the product was in time however just after two days of usage the charger went bad had called up amazon to query about the matter i was told to get in touch with samsung services but again the samsung services replied that the item was not in there stock and i had to atleast wait for 15 days to get it replaced the fact remains that i had bought this item as a gift to my sister and any gift turning out bad is totally embarassing hopefully next time onwards they wud check the items thousand more times before shipping it to the buyer
6284	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	the product is good but amazon has delivered a defective piece to me  the device heats up and also there is reception problem the device looses connectivity every now and then  i hope that amazon will call me to address my concern  please do not buy phones from amazon
6285	Samsung Galaxy Core GT-I8262 (Metallic Blue)	decent phone but not upto the great mark with latest new launches in below 10000 price battery is the worst as it is not even lasting one full day not 24 hrs only 12 hours  we need to keep the charge always with us again without many applications installed this is frequently getting hanged which is the worst to deal

6300	Micromax Bolt A58 (Red)	its a amazing device in this range  it touch is very good n and also support multitasking  it also have gpu which enables u to run games very smoothly it is best device in this range by me the only thing i dislike about it is that it have only 90 mb of internal memory that reaches its limit only by installing 4 or 5 big application of about 30 mb  but it offers a great experience by using this mobile in this range range it offers a lot of nice features therefore i suggest u to buy the phone without thinking it is an amazing mobile by all these features it hides its cons that it have less internal memory
6301	Micromax Bolt A58 (Red)	good phone at this price range it has 512mb ram due to this it runs smooth very nice product but the only problem is its internal memory which is very less due to less internal memory you can not install all software

6305	Micromax Bolt A58 (Red)	this is a valueformoney product i have managed to buy this for about inr 3100 which was a steal  i have been using this phone for the last 89 months and somewhat satisfied with the performance with a good data plan you can experience a smartphone which does not punch a hole in the pocket the screen size is good enough to easily use a browser or internet apps with a reasonably good user experience  with time however the touch sensitivity has degraded sometimes i had to reboot the phone to accomplish normal touch functionality i use whatsapp facebook and a few other apps however the internal memory is small and you cannot download too many apps when you add a micro sd card you would therefore restrict it to storing your favourite music or other data

6308	Micromax Bolt A58 (Red)	the phone at this price rate is  once a lifetime offer   simply outstanding yaar  pros dual core processor mali450 gpu 512 mob ram can play hd videos by default for me the best   3g up to 21mbps 2megapixels fixed focus camera gives 640×320 resolution which is excellent descent battery back up 422 jelly bean great touch  cons  nothing at all just rom should have been a little more  but look how much you are paying you are getting elephant for the price of chicken dont miss it cant find a better deal i got it for inr 3200 which is unbelievable i have brought 4 phones  recommended for all thank you micromax thank you amazonin

6318	Karbonn Titanium Wind W4 (White)	im rewriting my reviewi ordered this phone in november but wasnt working properlyso put it aside then in december around 1st i did a reset on phone  it started working properly  good thing about this phone is its battery life goes on  on  on camera is ok no zoom use oneshot instead display is pretty coolive no issues here build of phone again is good pretty for 5k price tag qualcomm quadcore processor again cool  bad thingswell its 4gb of rom shouldve been 8gbbut given windows its again not much to worry about 512 mb ram again shouldve been 1gb but given windows its ok doesnt affect much  overall  price of 5k im a satisfied customer 3 cheers to karbonn for this phone1st timer windows users can definitely buy it but there are other alternatives aswell
6319	Karbonn Titanium Wind W4 (White)	the finish of the body of the phone is very crude and not smooth the screen appearance is also not attractive and pleasing to the eye i wanted to return the phone and buy micromax canvas a 1 but the return was not accepted by the sellers as well as the amazon being their selling partners so like their product the return policy is also not dependable since i do not like it so will not use it
6320	Karbonn Titanium Wind W4 (White)	nice phone for the price paid much better than similarly priced android phones phone is quite light in weight and very comfortable to hold being a windows phone  there are no lags  no hangs  no reboots  nothing  phone works flawlessly  to my surprise  phone came with screen protector  fitted and one more spare in the box connectivity calling wifi etc call quality is satisfactory battery life much better than the competition  however  being a low priced phone  there are some short comings  1 screen is not bright enough 2 touch is a bit sluggish 3 fm not working as expected 4 camera is just average 5 build quality plastic is average  those who are on budget or want to try windows os or want a backup phone  this is perhaps the best one could find but again given the limitations and the price paid for dont expect this phone to work for years this is good enough of 12 years  anyway  who nowadays keeps the same handset for more than 3 years  honestly i am happy with this purchase  i am using it since last 15 days  not a single failure  this is remarkable  in contrast with many pricy phone  costing more than rs 15k  good job karbonn  and amazon for bring it to us  hope this helps thanks for looking
6321	Karbonn Titanium Wind W4 (White)	perfect and affordable as well got it for my mother and she seems happy with it the specification are decent to run games like asphalt 8 and gta sa go for it

6380	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	my 6th windows phone and it didnt disappoint me below are the pros and cons i found after 3 months of usage  pros  1 even though its host a  1430 mah battery with normal usage the charge lasts for two days 2 awesome call quality 3 rocking camera even without flash 4 touch is very good and responsive 5 sound is too good that was never expected 6 no lag at all with the 1 gb ram 7 easy to carry and finish is awesome too 8 good transfer speed both wifi and 3g 9 8gb inbuilt and 64 gb expandable feature for this price is good 10  easy update to windows 81  cons  1 no flash and no front cam 2 not producing good sound quality while using music player 3 less apps when compared to ios and google play  so just go ahead and buy it rather than getting lagging android phones out there for cheap prices
6381	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	the very good phone by nokia very impressive look and also nice quality ram is also good amount in this price
6382	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	whiile replying to any mail you can not attach file except pictures mean u can not attach word excel text etc
6383	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	first things first have been locked to symbian  nokia n8 since my tryst with mobility began and my brush with android has been limited to micromax funbook i am not an avid social networker nor do i use mobile email facility to use have a  softcorner for nokia brand was looking for an ideal gift for sub 10000 for so who needed to be initiated to the world of present day technology  also to expect a wowy expression from the recipient  after weighing various options limited to sony  nokia as was not at all interested to add to the ubiquitous samsung population zeroed in on lumia brand with lumia 520  525 making the grade superior battery  memory tilted the scale in 525s black favour i am glad it did as i feel so happy to watch my lil ones aiding their action heroes negotiate challenges thrown at them with ease  definitely without hiccups  reasons for buying lumia 525 black  found windows to be nonintrusive i say this because i have heard several of my colleagues complaining about googles penchant for collatingculling infomation from various sources viz emails facebook etc  putting it right there in your contacts without knowing whether the bonafide owner really finds this useful  decent looking elegant not eye catching not flashy no chrome plating or silver borders here silent worker  had been a great fan of nokias drive nokia music  nokia maps as an avid runner  driving entusiast mapping my speed at different terrains  finding routes have been greatly eased since i owned an n8  my son is hooked to nokia maps too  looked like a perfect gift for a person uninitiated to the ever expanding technological  world of  mobility i was not disappointed at all  experience post buying  no issues with windows os albeit we find it more intuitive smooth hiccup free  simple  completely satisfied  one aspect which every buyer of the phone should know beforehand which i was unaware of the alarm function of the phone works only with phone in on condition i found out after having missed my running schedule once now its almost a fortnight since the phone found its way into our lives we have made peace with this aspect although we do miss the feature as there are very bright chances that unwarranted phone calls jolts u out of sleep in the middle of the night we had the habit of switching off our mobiles before closing for the day  final word health conscious people looking for sub 10000 phones having passion for the outdoors wanting to break the clutter  not apprehensive of embracing a new platform can readily take the plunge the journey would be joyful  you will surely have lots of fun  pleasant surprises along the way  so readers should now know who the recipient of this gift was

6385	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	pros compact and pocketable wonderful touch screen user interface is easy very fresh and lively than android phones not many applications to boast of but all essential apps are there nokia music is free for 3 months and you will get some good music from the nokia store but the music file format is a little different than the usual mp3 economical price easy connectivity internet experience is fairly good and so is the gaming camera is good under day light and the music experience is great cons feel a little flimsy without a protective cover no front camera and no flash for the primary camera some problems with managing the files especially the music files overall a great buy for me as i like it very much right now

6391	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	i am using this phone for a year now sure now there are other lumia phones that are much better and cheaper than this one but this phone served me really good within thin one year this phone fell from my hands quite a few times yet no scratches on its screen i never experienced lag on highend games yes camera is good missed flash though this is my first lumia my first windows phone i bought this cheap one back then to check if i liked this platform or not it got updated from windows phone 8 to windows phone 81 microsoft did a decent amount of good changes in their os since last year still there is more we require though i will definitely go for another lumia next time and that time it will be a flagship or at least a highend one
6392	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	this is a really good phone for the price with its only serious contender being the moto e3  in terms of specs that is the moto e is cheaper though so why is this better than the moto e because of the os and the simplicity of using it windows phone has gotten much better with the 81 update and will continue to get even better the 1gb ram on this phone lets you run your apps with ease managing memory by moving apps and content is very easy with wp 81 finally the app gap between iosandroid and wp is fast coming close with all major apps coming in for windows phone as well if there is a sale on this be sure to pick it up you wont regret it
6393	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	everything is perfect except battery draining fast than expected  dint see a great difference between lumia 520 512 mb ram  lumia 525 1gb ram  i recommend this phone
6394	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	nokia with windows 8 is a formidable combination  it is a good phone to possess  only one sim card is an inconvinience
6395	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	the mobile is very slim and looks great awesome os its far better than samsung modelsits more than expected and finally i stongly recommend this phone
6396	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	the device has ability to support every app  as it carries 1 gb ram  allows processing in nice fashion i recommend this product 
6397	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	more smoothness more usability although all configs are same except the ram still performance is much more improved for those who blame the windows store check out once again all necessary apps can be found you will receive all updates from microsoft as the os part is directly controlled by microsoft and is not dependent on the handset maker if you are bored of using the same android and want to change the flavor then can try this one
6398	Nokia Lumia 525 (Black)	the battery back up is amazing along with a very good music download option for free  also i love gui of phone a lot its smooth to handle and looks are good too
6399	Nokia Lumia 520 (White)	ive pre ordered this phone and have been using this for last 2 days been using a lot of android phones till now and was bored of waiting for even call log to appear on them  pros   · thinner than expected and feels good in hands · camera does a good job a lot of innovative lenses to choose from · silky smooth ui which never hangs · highly responsive touch works even with gloves on · games never hang or lag · offline maps with nokia here works smoothly still google maps are better · nokia music lets you download all latest and old songs direct to the phone even regional language songs · full ms office suit · build quality is awesome with a mat finish on its back which gives a firm grip  cons · comparatively less apps that android but almost all required apps are present · no high end gaming as of now due to the 512 ram limitation  for the price this phone is too good to resist it has got everything to win your heart the colours on the screen appears very sharp and real i really cant think of any other phone which can give you these features even above 15k  for those who are still thinking about the apps one quick info  only microsoft and apple checks every apps before its put in the marketplace android has lots of apps but most of them are buggy they either drain out your battery or consume all the resources which results in poor performance every app in windows store is verified for its quality and you can be sure it wont slow down your phone in android if you install a few apps the phone will start slowing down but i tried around 30 apps installed in windows no slowing down was noticed i believe we should be looking at the quality of apps than the quantity  go ahead buy this phone you wont regret 
6400	Nokia Lumia 520 (White)	to tell the truth i wasnt too excited when nokia launched its lumia series with samsung htc and apple leading the smartphone wars nokia was left miles back surprising enough nokia struck back with its most impressive line of mobile phones till date joining forces with microsoft was a very smart move for nokia instead of developing its own os it went for windows 8 and left all the marketing of os to microsoft  when i heard the price of lumia 510 precursor to lumia 520 i was taken aback 10k for windows 75 phone still i waited for an update to windows 8 thats when lumia 520 was launched but for some reason or the other i couldnt buy it then one day i saw the price 6999 and bought it immediately online dont regret it one bit the best smartphone i ever had  pros  1 build quality superb on par with higher line of lumia series matt finish is just wonderful 2 screen size prefect for me at 4 inches this beauty is no doubt an amazing buy 3 display while it does not have clear text technology of lumia 620 its nevertheless every bit its worth only downside is reading in sunshine is not as clear as lumia 620 4 interface truly elegantif you think androidios is elegantuser friendlygive this beauty a try youll be astounded 5 apps all essential apps available though apps are not in the counts of android marketplace or app store you wont be disappointed as all essential apps we use daily are available 6 office 365 full ms office suit though many may not use this i use ms word quite regularly 7 colors amazing bright colors could easily give samsung a run for its money that only launches mobiles in black and white  cons 1 front camera not a deal breaker though at 7k or even 10k i expect nothing more 2 radio not a deal breaker i usually use tune in internet radio 3 flash no led flash now this was disappointing they could have added it 4 ram 512 mb ram even though processor is 1ghz and windows 8 demand less ram 1 gb could have added more value to the product still no deal breaker at this price   in 10k range this baby easily outsmarts every other smartphone give this beauty a try and you wont be disappointed easily one of the best buys i made this year
6401	Nokia Lumia 520 (White)	i am quite an old fashioned person when it comes to electronic gazettes i was never fascinated by smartphones tablets and other touch screen devices and was very happy with my simple basic mobile it was only accidentally that i gave it a thought to go for a smartphone after i lost my mobile and my technosavvy friend advised me to go for this  the transition from a simplest basic mobile to the smartphone could never be more easier thanks to nokia lumia 520 and windows 8  i do not know much technical bits to appraise this mobile but i can state many of its advantages from a laymans angle  1 excellent build quality i dropped it on a cement road from my bicycle to find it in three pieces but nothing was damaged 2 for its primary usage as a phone excellent voice quality speaker phone is at its best signal reception is also very good sms interface is very different than regular basic phones and i found it to be quite innovative 3 screen size of 4 is quite appropriate it fits in your palm well and goes in the packet very nicely 4 display quality is excellent it may not have the best viewing angle though but for a single viewer you get the best 5 windows 8 feels amazing very user friendly desktop kind of interface and positioning of apps could not be more simple 6 it will not be wise to ignore windows phones thinking that it does not have enough apps you would find apps for almost all of your needs 7 the most beautiful feature i found is the kids corner here you can create different profile for your kid and you will be at peace while your child is trying her hands at your mobile with this profile your child can not make any outgoing calls or can not mend with your important files in the phone  though there are some limitations as below  1 there is no front camera but what more can you expect in a budget phone 2 no radio but for me it doesnt matter i do have best radio apps downloaded in my phone 3 there is no key to search within mobile instead there is a key that takes you to the web search engine bing i cant justify a separate key only to search over web 4 lack of dual sim dont understand why nokia does not have this  overall i found this to be the best smartphone with a budget below 10k  go for it even if your budget is more than it it is worth for each and every paisa
6402	Nokia Lumia 520 (White)	hi actually now i got time to share about my product what i have purchased from youfirst of all i brought it online instead retail shops with this much spent because of the site named amazonin my phone having some defects like 1the second call name and number is not appearing during the phone call when data services not in use butif i am using data servicesall things is going good2some of the timesthe size of the fonts are getting big and i cannot resize itin this times i need to restart my phone3the phone was strucking unexpectedlyat this time it is making me to remove the battery and needs reinsert into it4final thing is i cant find my service warrantyhope you will understand what i am facing with the productrevert me with positive cheers
6403	Nokia Lumia 520 (White)	i ordered this product based on the positive reviews i received on all forums when i received the product and started it it worked beautifully except for the camera where the button just did not get pressed on searching the forums i found that there is this issue with its cover which needed to be removed and fitted again after doing that i found that the button depressed only halfway through to focussing i had to click on the camera screen to click the photo after going to the forums again i found that this is a common manufacturing defect with nokia 520s i had to return the product as i did not want to get it fiddled with by the service people  when i buy a new piece it has to work right the first time  no repairs please hence one star less i wish nokia paid a little more attention to the manufacturing quality of this hot selling model
6404	Nokia Lumia 520 (White)	pros   · thinner and feels good in hands · camera does a very good job · awesome ui  never hangs · responsive touch · offline maps with nokia · download all latest and old songs direct to the phone · ms office suit · build quality is awesome  cons · no high end gaming as of now due to the 512 ram limitation
6405	Nokia Lumia 520 (White)	error error unable to find a bootable option press any key to shut down before you think of purchasing any lumia phone  please surf on google for the given error there is no exact reason known why phones working perfect suddenly cease to function and display this error error unable to find a bootable option press any key to shut down on the screen with a black background none of the recovery tools on the microsoft website or anywhere else cannot repair this phone the nokia care also is unaware why this happens and ask their customers to replace the motherboard which costs 90 of the cost  there are thousands of customers who are facing this problem and have their lumia phones turned into paperweights  please inform your friends if they have any lumia phone to use very carefully  i have myself used the phoen and no doubt nokia made a perfect masterpiece but microsoft windows on this phone sucks and microsoft itself still havent came forward with any of software to get it sorted so think before u purchase
6406	Nokia Lumia 520 (White)	this is my second lumia 520 which i got for my wife first one was got from flipkart 4 months back i have used it throughly for 4 months and its the best value for money at the given price debate on 512 ram vs 1 gd is irrelevant for me as i dont use it for gaming for all office work its perfect with skydrive office and tight integration with windows the size is perfect to carry in pocket as i hate huge phone you lug in your hand nokia is a tough machine mine has endured upteen falls without a scratch touch is slick no lagthere is a issue with the camera button but that just requires aligninig the cover properly i suggest dont buy a case as the sheen of the nokia will be lost with that simple screen guard will do this phone can take rough handling regarding delivery made in promised time neatly gift packed the tracking on amazon is haywire they need to catch up with flipkart where you can track the parcel by the hour my queries on web chat were promptly addressedbut amazon has competition in facei brrought this below 8000 as it was cheapest among all online sellers
6407	Nokia Lumia 520 (White)	the product was purchased by me around a year ago and i have been thoroughly satisfied the white colour was my colour of choice since it was attractive windows phone 8 is a very competitive platform and although apps are not much there is a certain distinctive look and feel about windows phones especially lumia although i would not suggest anyone to buy it right now but the platform is very nice i enrolled on the preview for developers and have been loving it first to get the updates get a windows phone with at least 1gb of ram like the recent lumia 535 and so on other than that i have no complaints even the people at the service centres are quick to respond they mended my lock button since it was covered under warranty had no issues there all in all i love lumia and now microsoft

6409	Sony Xperia E3 (Single SIM, White)	ive been using this phone for almost a month now and to be quite honest the phone performs surprisingly well sony has come up with a good value for money product without compromising on the build quality and the ui to a large extent the outer body does feel quite good and even after a good deal of time spent on the web there was no heating issues the battery back up is simply amazing on this device low to medium usage sustains the phone for almost two days no gaming the ui is eye catching with sharp animations and a good feel however sony could have improved their secondary camera for this model and could have increased the screen resolution another down point for the phone is the limited internal memory but that can be solved with an external sd card an android l update is not expected however sony does roll out a few updates for bug fixes greatest feature is the brilliant battery and the worst  is the external speaker at the back calls are awful on speaker overall the phone is quite good in the budget segment but not the best it provides a good user experience and is quite snappy even while multi tasking and switching between five to six apps not games
6410	Sony Xperia E3 (Single SIM, White)	biggest negative point about this phone is that you cannot directly download anything on your sd card first you have to download it on internal memoryonly 175gb available for apps and other stuff out of which hardly 200400 mb space is available this means that you cannot download a whole movie or anything with more than 400 to 500 mb similarly you cannot receive any file directly on sd card by bluetooth wifi direct nfc or any other means only after receiving on internal memoryonly if you have free space in internal memorythen you have to transfer this is something that irritates

6449	Panasonic Eluga I (Silver)	its amazing phone
6450	Samsung Galaxy Trend (Dual SIM, Midnight Black)	the performance of the phone is really bad i would not recommend to buy this instead you can buy micromax  i already have micromax a 76 which is of the same price i bought samsung because of the brand name but hugely disappointed that it does not support the games as in micromax a76 like hay day subway surfers etc  the phones gets hanged and the applications are closed automatically  i finally use this phone only to attend calls like a basic phone
6451	Samsung Galaxy Trend (Dual SIM, Midnight Black)	very slow hangs sometimescamera average may be good if it gets the latest android kitkat upgraderam size less than needed
6452	Samsung Galaxy Trend (Dual SIM, Midnight Black)	samsung continues to exploit their brand name by introducing very low end devices for a higher price this phone is clearly overprized the performance of the device is not good at all 1 ghz single core processor is not enough to handle multitasking with ease and the heavy touchwiz ui makes things worse this only has 512mb of ram the battery backup is also not goodit cant even last a day of average use    specs   1 ghz single core processor 512 mb ram 480 x 800 pixels 40 inches tft display android jellybeanwith touchwiz interface on top 3 mp camera  poor quality  no front camera 1500mah battery  my recommendation is to pay a few more bucks and go for quadcore1gb ram devices like xolo q700xolo q700s etc coming under 10k galaxy trend is clearly not a value for money device
6453	Samsung Galaxy Trend (Dual SIM, Midnight Black)	actually one of friend suggested to buy here so i bought a mobile for my husband even though its new its not working properly phone hangs off totally  break down offen so want to return when in final process even dat was not working out am very much upset through this 
6454	Samsung Galaxy Trend (Dual SIM, Midnight Black)	it was so much bad experience with that phonevery slow every times hang much more cost high in comparison to its features no flash light no front camera overall i just wanna say dont waste your time and money to buy this bulls
6455	Samsung Galaxy Trend (Dual SIM, Midnight Black)	nice phone with reasonable price not a great fit for advance and highly active users great phone for those who are looking to shift to smart phone
6456	Samsung Galaxy Trend (Dual SIM, Midnight Black)	prosesor is not working properly some time mobile touch screen not workig some time any one app not working  mobile is very very slow
6457	Samsung Galaxy Trend (Dual SIM, Midnight Black)	the phones gets hanged and the applications are closed automatically 3 mp camera  poor quality  no front camera picture quality is not that clear and also sometimes there is issue in volume control battery back up is no good  it cannot even last for a day average while in use  but yes i liked amazon delivery service got the phone in hand before expected within 2 days

6476	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Black)	i bought it for rs11677 in october 2013 service by amazon is just great now about the phone by this time march 2015 the phone has almost became obsolete the price is still around 11k its 3d hardware at that time was out standing but considering todays standards its kind of obsolete too  points to consider 1good reliable brand name with reasonable price in its 1 and half years i rarely faced any problems regarding software or hardware a positive  2internal storage is only 4 gb only about 17 gb available for apps  and you cannot move your apps to sd card   unless you root your phone and lose warranty so the hardware it has is of not much use for gamers  a big negative  3 still pretty much responsive never have lagged much consider the phone is 1 and half years old  a positive  4 camera only good for outdoor photos very poor camera performance in low light and auto focus in video mode has a mind of its own a big negative  5 very good battery life even after 1 and half years it only has a 1700mah battery but it usually lasts for a day and recharges to full with in an hour or more a big positive  6 handy and stylish design a positive  final advice  this phone was good considering its price and brand name in 2013 and 2014 now its time for retirement for this wonderful product in todays market march 2015 you can have so many options for this price range 1012k and far better phones in 15k price range from if you want a small 4 inch reliable  phone with decent battery life and sony brand name you may buy it
6477	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Black)	excellent phone works flawlessly only thing i could do without was having to cut my mini sim to micro sim also the phone ships with android 422 not 41 as advertised  edit after using it a few days now ive discovered that the phone lacks a gyroscope sensor this means that you will not be able to use the phone to play tilt to steer games like need for speed you will also never be able to get photosphere camera working on this phone as that needs a gyro  the remaining features work like a charm its been fast and responsiveeven after installing a lot of apps ive installed about 50 apps so far and no noticeable lag yet and i get a full days usage out of it even with 3g turned on all day  edit 2 the camera as of now has some severe autofocus issues autofocus does not seem to work very well in general resulting in blurry photos but the problem is severe in case of low light also the camera does not seem so sensitive most samsung cameras and my x10 minipro camera are leagues ahead one star off
6478	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Black)	i purchased this product on the brand name of sony from the market it stopped working after 13 months from the date of purchase due to motherboard failure cost of new motherboard claimed is rs 5800 by sony xperia service center at kanpur  same thing happened with my one of my friends so with this experience i learnt to not to purchase any xperia product in future  it is a suggestion to flipkart and coming customers to blacklist such type of products so that less people may get cheated
6479	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Black)	sony name is enough for quality of product xperia m dual proves its 34sony34 in all department except its camera camera is not upto the mark another factor is you cant install application on sd card this is bad part of this mobile and sony provide only 4 gigs memory out of only 2 gigs is available for end user  pros  android 422 preinstalled on device nice design and ui good 434 screen sony music quality battery life is good 1 day good wifi reception dual micro sim  cons  5 mp camera not produce good result only 2gb internal memory for end user memory expansion slot is useful for media only not application and games
6480	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Black)	but having one limitation internal memory only 4 gb and usable only 2gb all apps gets downladed in to internal memory so that we can have only limitted apps we need to move apps manully to storage area to free the meory
6481	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Black)	its working well after using of 1weak  bettry service is 1day great sound and picture quality  true multitasking mobile camera also very good with true hdr mood in around 11k its far better then samsung
6482	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Black)	lowered the rating bcoz i didnt get the order the item got stolen during transit but relly amazed  happy with the speed at which amazon has resolved my issue  refunded me really very quick  efficient customer care service will be back here soon

6485	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Black)	the packaging is very nice and delivery was on time the phone is quite a value for money smart phone it is one of the best in the price rangeonly problem the earphones are weak and sound quality is not good as expected from sony

6506	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	hi all it is really a good mobile  lite weight good looking and fast processing   in terms of camera it is not really so gud front camera is totally waste
6507	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	it u want to awesome phone then must gosuprb speed problem only with that u cant transfere all memory content except midia file to external memery
6508	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	i have little to tell with the 8 months of usage    mmm if you use 3g net  as usual the phone will become hot and with in 45 mins of continous use battery will drain from 100 to 15   one thing i didnt like is its camera clarity its poori cant use the camera in any situation if i am giving to take photo to some other personscamera requires more time to take and save picture and so every person will take and will move the phone  leading to blurred image   you cant use to track the gps accurately as it depends on network also with my bsnl 3g i cant track while roaming in tamilnadu once   you cant take selfi in clarity   am having dual sim phone and no complaints to phone its working well   phone is not getting hanged i have installed a lot of apps 95 icons in total in the menu list still working perfectly   battery i think is the best with my normal usage of net and calls i can use for one day easily and i think standby is around 2 and half days   any how in this class its worthy for the money spending and you cant expect more for this money
6509	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	value for money build quality is very good sound quality is known as expected  battery is superb it good start
6510	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	i chose this phone  since i primarily use my phone for calls  messages  office mail  camera and music and a few social apps i also dont like big screen size as it typically does not fit in my jeans  xperia m has the perfect screen size  neither too big nor too small  for my needs  also the phone is light so one can keep it in the shirt pocket as well   sonys phones are known for their camera and sound  so that fits my other needs as well
6511	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	i owned this phone 6 months back i m still not having any problems but the camera quality suffers which is i think bad compared to what samsung gives in 5 megapixels the camera quality at day time is good but horrible at night timeand the front camera is really bad u cannot take a decent selfie and u cant move apps to sd card other wise this phone is a good buy
6512	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	ive gifted this mobile to my cousin and he i happy with it was able to upgrade to 43 after connecting the phone for the first time to pc im using xperia l but havent received 43 update only think lacking is less internal memory  overall performance is good as always amazon the best delivery service
6513	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	the device specification doesnt match its website description a downgraded phone received details   1  ram 62 768 mb instead of 1 gb   2  internal storage 62 2 gb instead of 4 gb
6514	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	the product delivery is as scheduled about the product as a brand sony maintained quality its worth to buy in budget of 11 k battery backup is less as compared with other brand smart phones
6515	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	its about one month i m using dis product everything is fine except front camera which is worthless more bad than starting time vga camera no use u cant use it even in sufficient light rear camera gives good images only in good light condition in low light condition its performance is average in this price sony at least can provide inear good quality handsfree the handsfree they r providing is good but they have to provide other features are working quite good
6516	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	sony xperia india says you can keep both sim cards active at all times 8211 meaning that you can talk on one sim and still receive calls on the other instead of going to voicemail settingsdual sim settings other settingsmutual call forwarding refer link indian site but its wrong there is only one option available mutual call transfer between two sims if we activate mutual sim call dirvert who will bear call forwarding charges sony corp i need solution or replacement with new one
6517	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	i had bought the phone on 22nd may and it got delivered to me on 23rd may  excited about phone i was delighted by sonys product quality for its user interface voice quality display features etc  did detailed verification on weekend and found that there is actually 2 gb rom instead of 4 gb  first disappointment  external sd card was not getting detected by multiple attempts i have even formatted sd card with win 32 format but no use  second disappointment  finally i called up amazon customer care they given me an option to refund the money i opted for it  but definitely one thing i can say sonys product was good  since i am normal phone user with sturdy phone i found it was delicate to operate without proper covers  but i was fan of walkman feature  and display characteristics  camera feature was also good
6518	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	the speaker of the phone was not working properly right from day 1 the audio goes too light many of the times and the counter party is not able to hear properly i have to now take it to the authorised service center to get its health checked
6519	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	it is a good product but not as much i was expecing from this sony xperia m dual sim white
6520	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	sony xperia m dual a very thankood phone i liked it i got a sony headphone along with it it was unexpectedthanks to amazone
6521	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	i thought its a lowest price that amazon is offering but my sony experia m dual sim is defected it has a scratch on screen and another thing is camera is not up to the mark in low lighting it works like a vga camera n flash is also unable to give quality
6522	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	cam is just ok battery manageable but i m facing problem wid voice clarity while callingn i have already used lenovo n samsung compared to them in a same or even below price rangeit dont have any such a special features or app that can please u personally i found lenovo bestexcept battery issue  in sony  dual sim cant work at a time   but other phone it does  not really satisfied wid this phone if you are just buying for brand then fine
6523	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	its good but online youtube videos are playing in small screen but k we can feel comfortable with mobile service given by amazon is also good
6524	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	i got sony m dual from amazon  and found that it lacks user friendly  speed dial one touch dialling found  even in low end phones as well as in smart phones and  confirmed with sony service alsonot found in xperia models  even the resolution  is not good as compared with sony phones of similar price range  amazon is so  generous to  accept my return request  and  returned the phoneif you  can manage  without this facility you can go for it  i am very much pleased with amazons lightning delivery  but i dont know why amazon does not inform  customers over phone to confirm their presence  to receive the product
6525	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, White)	this product have so much good looking shining so it is too good for gifting purpose very nice quality product
6526	Lenovo A680 (Black)	i bought this phone on first week of dec14 at first i found this to be a excellent phone built was good plastic but this is expected at this price ui is customized by lenovo being samsung user initially faced difficulty in finding options couldnt find option till last date to check if ram is actually of 1gb as claimed i faced two issues with this  1 gravity sensor of the phone is non existent turn the phone and wait for it to rotate the screen and if by chance you have rotated it by mistake it will take eternity to come back to original forget about playing games on it i learned it hard way and had to disable the feature itself  2 some times i was not able to receive incoming calls as the slide function wont work it happened very random but happened for sure i checked lenovo forum checked other website but couldnt find solution i checked with one of my friend who bought same phone about 2months back he was also facing same issue it was then that i decided to return it back as it seems issue with the phone sw or hardware and it makes no sense to have a phone which dont allow you the basic function of a phone ie receive a call
6527	Lenovo A680 (Black)	at this price this piece is good  its little heavy though  a flash light would have made little difference to this big device  the quality of ear phone is pathetic they should consider replacing it with in ear phones
6528	Lenovo A680 (Black)	lenovo a680 is yet another mtk6582 quadcore 1gb ramunder rs 10000 device out there the performance of the device is like any other device powered by this processor it gives good gaming performance and overall multitasking is lag free  camera  this is one of the biggest disappointing thing about this phone this is a fixed focus cameraso you cant always get the area you want to focus in focus touch to focus is also not functional another disappointing thing about the device is the display resolution480 x 854 pixels resolution on a 5inches screen is not that great to look at but its okusable  it houses a 2000mah which is powerful enough to get you through a day of moderate use it is running on android 42 jellybean unlike other budget devices lenovo ships their modified user interface instead of the more smoother and faster stock ui the ui is a mixed bagit looks good in some areasand looks unpolished in some other sections  overall a good budget devicewith good performance the antutu benchmark score is around 17500 which is quite good fixed focus camera is one the major cons of the device
6529	Lenovo A680 (Black)	i love it its having all features and very good deal in this amounti strongly recommend this fone to those who want good fone in reasonable price
6530	Lenovo A680 (Black)	was just browsing around on amazon and found this phone on the hourly deal anyhow i was inquisitive of android system so got the phone in a flash and wow it lived upto my expectations lenovo a680 is a good phone with good specs and i am happily enjoying games and apps on the phone
6531	Lenovo A680 (Black)	bought it at around 5k from amazon  pros  value for money nice display better than i expected good android experience no lag smooth touch good video recording speaker is pretty loud call quality is good nice audio quality use good quality headphone  cons  battery suddenly dropping from 85 to 15 after restarting happened 2 times out of 5 restarts over a period of 3 days overall battery backup is poorer than expected dont buy it if you want long hours of gaming3g browsing no screen protector is provided screen is reflective no camera flash 5mp still camera is not up to the mark
6532	Lenovo A680 (Black)	touch screen is not good i am struggling to operate sometimes with touch screen it is not responding properly it is hanging while operating something
6533	Lenovo A680 (Black)	a good phone from lenovo i recommend it for the features and price rangethe drawback being the 2 gb internal memoryalso i had an issue with the screen calibration as the touch screen was not responding at a few places but it was replaced by the service centre guys at bangalorealso was surprised to know that lenovo has just 2 service centers in bangalore which is really bad
6534	Lenovo A680 (Black)	i am convinced  it is worth works fine touch is good worth paying for the model cheap but with good features  dhana
6535	Lenovo A680 (Black)	overall good phone battery life is also good the only problem if thickness should be less and also should be light in weight
6536	Lenovo A680 (Black)	its a good phonenyc featurescomes preloaded with applications like gameloft calendarmailetc but whatsapp not loadedtwitter facebook also preloadedthe camera however has no flashrest is all finemacrosim slots available
6537	Lenovo A680 (Black)	good budget smart phone from lenovo good battery and good performance 1gb ram and 5mp camera in this range is really a treat for the users
6538	Lenovo A680 (Black)	the advantage is most same of the features at lower price when compared other branded phones but following are the disadvantages 1 rear camera quality is poor even it boasts of 5mp i didnt expect the camera quality to be soo poor also  no zoom facility known when ordering 2 many at times the touch screen doesnt work properly especially at the rightleftend of the screen need to press harder
6539	Lenovo A680 (Black)	lenovo a680 phone is bad this phone motion senser is not working please do not purchase this phone
6540	Lenovo A680 (Black)	the touch pad is pathetic worst experience when writing notes and contacts forget playing motion games on this phones even temple run turns cant be made pathetic low price chinese mall i baught it for my mom  she loves it as this is her first smart phone but i should have gone for moto e
6541	Lenovo A680 (Black)	gd mobile worth for the price pic quality can be improved
6542	Lenovo A680 (Black)	its accelerometer is not working properly if you wish to play games like temple run 2 or gt racing then forget about it but at this price its the best phone
6543	Lenovo A680 (Black)	i bought this for amazon but so worst item given  to me that the company is a little bit fraud i give minus ranking its mobile phone touch very worst
6544	Lenovo A680 (Black)	great product at this price when i purchased good built quality touch response is good battery backup more than average ram management is really good
6545	Lenovo A680 (Black)	this is a damn good phone for such a budgeti got this for inr 4970 i am using this for the past one and half month not yet felt any problems

6560	Lenovo S920 (Blue, 8GB)	received lenovo s920 4 gb instead my order for lenovo s920  8gb please dont cheat regretting the purchase from amazon
6561	Lenovo S920 (Blue, 8GB)	nice phone with this price very light weightgood touch responsebut check warranty in lenovo site after purchase very nice service provided by amazon 
6562	Lenovo S920 (Blue, 8GB)	good product for this price better than samsung and other smart phones in this price range with all new features
6563	Lenovo S920 (Blue, 8GB)	got the s920 blue 8 gb yesterdayi was looking for a smart phone below 15k which sported bigger screen with high hd did lot of research and i picked s920this is my first smart phonegood things abt this phone is camera and screen quality user interfacelight weight  i would recommend this phone if u are a multi media person who likes to watch videos and movies play games surfing emails with battery backup etc and do not waste money on expensive ones like htcgoolge etc  it might not easily fit in the pocket and is little uncomfortable when using a 2 wheeler with the phone in the pocket  when buying a smart phone it is purely what u want to do with a smart phone more importantly than how much is ur budget
6564	Lenovo S920 (Blue, 8GB)	the delivery was rather delayed due to the many holidays that arrived however the dealer didnt contact me before delivery he just dropped in its been 20 days since i started using this phone its pretty decent however i prefer touch of the htc desire series much more the quality of the accessories is absolutely cheap the charger seems to be made of cheap plastic the only and most important positive aspect of this phone is the battery even with complete usage i need to charge it once in two days lenovos battery is just brilliant
6565	Lenovo S920 (Blue, 8GB)	nice handset big screen easy typing but should have latest upgrade of android kitkat primary camera quality is fine however secondary could have also made better
6566	Lenovo S920 (Blue, 8GB)	the product by itself is 34amazing34 screen is very clear  crisp sound is decent connectivity is awesome in terms of gsm and offcourse there is bt wifi  but lenovos latest android os is so heavily skinned that it looks like a cheap ios copy and the only way to make you feel you are using an android is to go to setting 62 about phone 62 version info or you can change the launcher
6567	Lenovo S920 (Blue, 8GB)	delivered as promised had purchased after reading many reviews of several smart phones i am not a technical person the phone really amazed me not only by the looks but also the features and performance i have used several smart phones in the past and am now the ardent fan of lenovo i strongly recommend that you go for it if your budget is around this

6581	Gionee P2S (White)	nice phone in this range
6582	Nokia Asha 311 (Dark Grey)	i didnt buy this on amazon india but i own this same model this was the first asha phone to have 3g connection 3g has better signal reception than 2g in addition to its more speed this is a gsm phone and requires a normal sized sim when i bought mine nokia was giving a free over the ear headphone 20 free games from ea and free music on its music app for a couple of months i didnt receive the free over the ear headphone there werent that many good games on ea and free music soon expired in the box you receive the phone battery power adapter earphones and manual you wont receive any usb cable to connect to your computer or laptop you have to buy that separately spending around rs 300 in a nokia store i got a 2gb micro sd instead of 4 gb new ones come with 1 year limited warranty  this is not a smartphone this is dummy phone with extra features there are lot better alternatives in android from local market here in india if you want a smartphone at this price range you better consider phones from micromax lava etc  in india nokia wrongly advertised this phones single core 1 ghz processor as perfect for mobile gaming but the gaming on this phone looks like gaming from early generation like 16bit era even the 3d games look blocky dont be fooled by the sleek images nokia puts out for this phone this phone uses series 40 os which is not as good as android or windows nokia provides its own version of apps for facebook twitter and whatapp line mail etc which i havent tried i feared that these apps might steal my username and password there is no instagram app  its screen size is approximately 19 inches horizontally and 27 inches vertically not big nokia advertises its screen size as 3 inches i guess they measure it diagonally websites appear small but you can zoom and enlarge the text flash videos on any website dont play because of its small ram of 128 mb and other hardware limitations you can forget about reading any ebooks i tried to load many ebooks of many formats including pdf but none opened it doesnt have a built in app to handle pdfs you have to download a third party app  photos and videos taken with 32 mp camera with the back cover on look blurry and washed out one of the reasons for bad quality photos and videos is the plastic transparent on the back cover if you take photos and videos without the back cover they are lot clean in good light and passable but you should be careful while doing this as the battery falls out the camera interface doesnt give control over shutter speed iso settings although it does have exposure control and effectslike negative sepia etc frames and fun sounds which you can choose for your camera shutter there is also an option to turn on grid in the camera interface which i never found helpful but i guess it helps in framing the shot  it has 2 buttons on the right sidewhen the phone is viewed from the front the lockunlock button gets stuck a lot and doesnt function  the bluetooth communication is fast when the communicating devices are close and wifi connection is also fast depending on your connection to turn on or off the bluetooth and wifi you have to slide down an interface from the top of the screen where you can also select the sound profile and turn on or off the mobile service internet connection this interface also serves as the notification center showing you the number of missed calls and unread messages  contacts dont have grouping feature and the search in contact is also not efficient call logs and message logs dont allow you to sort them by day week and month view there is a limit to the number of notes you can make this phone has alarm feature which you can use to wake yourself up i tried it once but i dont remember hearing its alarm this alarm shows cute graphic on the screen at the set time  it allows you to choose from different color themes the official green theme looks a lot like yellow you can use any jpeg or gif of a certain dimension as the wallpaper  even when bluetooth mobile internet connection and wifi are always off the battery lasts only a day or so with moderate usage  the only good thing is the call quality when the signal reception is good speaker on the other end sound as if they are in the same room with you  all in all if you dont rely heavily on your mobile phone for social media and internet browsing this can be good depending on your needs nokia had a great opportunity to create topnotch compact phone but it lost it i bought it as it was made in nokias indian factory and has an india name my old phone was also malfunctioning
6583	Nokia Asha 311 (Dark Grey)	the phone is bad for many reasons  the touch screen has failed within 14 months of usage  when making calls the touch screen is automatically activated  when earphones are on touch screen doesnt work at times  all in all its a bad phone to have i guess nokia is better for low end phones
6584	Nokia Asha 311 (Dark Grey)	its a good phone but not in this prize  prize must be 3000 then it has somthing to buy  except 3 g network this mobile has nothing to be fond off  dont go for this one it is a full waste of money
6585	Nokia Asha 311 (Dark Grey)	no multitasking even if it has wifi it needs data connection many times to proceed whatsapp on this phone is not fully functional you can not send receive contact via whatsapp
6586	Karbonn Titanium S4 Plus (White)	i bought this phone to gift my bapi and it was so hurting and shameful that it just keep hanging even when no apps are installed on it the base phone itself have lots of ads that keeps popping up most disgusting part is i bought this as a gift and gave it travelling to other end of india and turned out to be a waste its feels like cheated when u get such product in a box back 1st buy unsure how they are gonna fix it as the phone was to give them convenience and now taking it to service center and getting it repaired is like a lifetime task i feel guilty of trusting karbonn should have put some extra penny on known brand karbonnneveragain

6596	Sony Xperia Z3 (White)	best in market remember snapdragon 810 has heating issues and next gen chipset will support finger print scanner other options htc one m8 and moto x htc one m8 has little old chipset compare to z3 and moto x has its own flaws  this is best and safe to be considered in terms on build quality and battery life and also screen quality
6597	Sony Xperia Z3 (White)	buyed this mobile as i have already used sony z2 and no doubt z2 was awesome  i am sure i got a defective peacebecause my mob stopped working after 57 hrs and died for ever  what i did in these hours i just charged it to 100 and install some app and games
6598	Sony Xperia Z3 (White)	phone is excellent but after watching videos and playing games for an hour or two i can see the phone getting overheated otherwise its an awesome phone in terms of build quality camera display and most importantly battery
6599	Sony Xperia Z3 (White)	love the phone but there are a few camera and double tap to wake glitches that i could have done without i have not tried it underwater yet hopefully it works fine overall i would recommend the phone to to other buyers
6600	Sony Xperia Z3 (White)	the best flagship device on the current market its one of the best camera and camcorder in a water proof smartphoneit it water and dust proof so u can take photos in a swimming pool it gives great battery life of 2days and its better than an iphone in display the brightest display in a smart phone207 mp great low light camera dont is the best in cameras bigger screen and greater durability than an iphone its the best buy if u want to satisfy your need and an iphone if u want to show off thank you

6613	Micromax Unite A092 (Classy Black)	performance and build quality is goodamazon needs to improve their packingbecoz in camera view from the mobile there is a small line deductedbcoz of the packing it happened so
6614	Micromax Unite A092 (Classy Black)	this one is just a mess gets over heated very quickly its minimum temp is 40 degree celsius at start up and also the battery backup is poor lasts hardly 4 hours
6615	Micromax Unite A092 (Classy Black)	the only disadvantage of a092 is its fixed focus camera and battery but it produces some very good pictures outdoor it runs smooth and gaming performance is also good
6616	Micromax Unite A092 (Classy Black)	bought this specifically for the purpose of gps gps accuracy is very bad in this product so returned not aware of the other aspects lookwise it is a bit bulky

6625	iBall Andi 4U Frisbee (Special Wine)	iball 4u frisbee is right choise to normal user by android os which means if you are harcore games fan then please dont choose this one because this smartphone run smoothly these type of games like eg subway surfers candy crush temple run etc not recommened for big games by this one like san andreas mobile real racing etc  so if you r a normal user then go to buy this one its a right choice whatsapp fb chatting browsing playing movies etc  pros very smooth touch very sensitve lightweight easly to handle  not worry for if your handset is dropdown at couple of time the handsets body and battery are ejected when the product is dropped down from you  good speed good camera good sound clarity accessories have build quality like earphone charger  cons i saw the one disadvantage is this mobile battery backup but it doesnt matter for android phones especially kitkat devices are there have common issue but standby and normal call and sms usage at rare internet use or social mesaaging have a good battery backup  verdict if you r looking an android device with normal usage then go for it and its have many advanced featres like gorilla glass etc at 5k budget is a right  choice don choose xolo one and micromax canvas fire
6626	iBall Andi 4U Frisbee (Special Wine)	im a moderate user of internet and games so here is my review pros os is good performance is good no lagging rear camera is good enough space for downloading basic apps and games provided with 8 gb memory 4 covers wine red black orange and sky blue are added advantage corning gorilla glass takes away your stress of breaking its screen by any accident  cons front camera is of no use its like having a smartphone with no front camera battery drains too fast even in the moderate use ive to charge it 2 times a day to keep it going
6627	iBall Andi 4U Frisbee (Special Wine)	hats off to the service rendered by amazonits a nice budget phonednt expect more from this price range the main drawback is the battery backupyou have to charge atleast twice to stay connectedcamera is 8 mp but expect photos from a 3 mplight weightfaster downloads  610  is my score

6630	Gionee Elife E7 Mini (Black)	gionee elife e7 mini with elife life goes easily its one among the best phones to buy at a reasonable price hardware components are of good quality no doubt it has a very sleek and beautiful body the rotatable camera is of added advantage while taking selfpics though it doesnt perform well in dark environment it allows us to take high quality pics during day light however 1 gb ram is the only specification which falls short especially when i play real racing 3 minimum ram usage i have seen so far is around 400mb amigo gui may not be as light as androids ui but it is equally beautiful people who are accustomed to android gui may have little difficulty to adapt to the new gui network connectivity wifi and bluetooth performs way above expectations  overall an excellent phone to buy if are not a big gamer then you can buy it without a second thought  thanks to amazon for its quick delivery to bangalore received within 40 hours of booking
6631	Gionee Elife E7 Mini (Black)	superlike  camera quality is more than expectation  clarity is more good than xperia z camera  overall performance is well but due to aamigo ui its somewhere slow but you can use different launcher to make it faster  overall its good duaal sim performance is also a killer  i like gesture feature a also  and also thanks amazon to deliver it in 1 day 
6632	Gionee Elife E7 Mini (Black)	overall with all the cons of this phone i think its worth to buy hi guys i really love this phone great performance great camera etc
6633	Gionee Elife E7 Mini (Black)	the cam is excellent  but it cannot capture moving objects there is a problem with music the desktop takes time to load  at last the phone is vgud by its looks but also has disadvantages at the other side charge is not satisfactory
6634	Gionee Elife E7 Mini (Black)	hai guys i was first in a panic state when i heard the name gionee never heard but i just wanted to buy this phone because of  the cool feature so called rotating camera its been 3 months i bought this phoneand i am proud to say that i was the first one who bought this phone after release from amazon  just one word to describe this phone is just awesome  i havent seen any phone so far with such a high end video resolution its hd 1280p recording when i see the recorded video its like a blueray it doesnt matter if its day or night  the phone screen resolution is soo realistic   wonderful finishing  awesome outlook and rotating camera feature is soo adorable  being octacore its performance is too good  the only disappointment is that it doesnt have expandable memory but adjustable with otg cable connected to my 1tb harddisk stuffed with lots of movies p  awesome awesome awesomeawesome
6635	Gionee Elife E7 Mini (Black)	gionee elite e7 is greatbut if not affordable go for the mini it wont disappoint you great featuressmooth performance value for money hundred times better than the samsung crap phones dont go for brand go gionee  the godfather of all mobiles 
6636	Gionee Elife E7 Mini (Black)	this is the first time i am using a android based phone been always a nokia loyal thus far given below are my observations   positives  the handset is great  so is the battery back up very sturdy  seems to be made of great quality photographs quality is awesome voice clarity ability to catch signals in weak areas is also good  negatives  the user manual is pathetic loading of phone directory is a cumbersome task logging onto the gionees website does not really help in making it user friendly  adapting to the phone when someone spends 17k plus on the phone there are some basics that we expect like having provision for entering birthdays  getting reminded through a display service centres are limited  not responsive  a serious concern etc  overall hence i have rated at 3 on 5 would have liked to give it more but 
6637	Gionee Elife E7 Mini (Black)	i am using this mobile from 2015 feb onwards this is d best one  battery back up was superbstylish look with rotating camera finally i can say that with in 17 k  gionee e7 mini was best

6653	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Purple)	biggest disvantage of this phone is u cant move ur apps from internal memory which is only 2 gb to sd card  my sd card of 16 gb is a total waste without this feature  if u r a fan of lots of games and apps  this is not the phone for u i purchased this phone from here 4months back and is really very unsatisfied
6654	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Purple)	i have brought this item from amazon but i face technical problem in this product and also technical problem in other item
6655	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Purple)	sony xperia m dual is a good phone in this price range it meets all needs of a customer who wants a good smartphone never got slow till now
6656	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Purple)	my first android device good experience it fit all my requirements  below 434 screen ram  good enough camera with flash lightweight  as you can find at other websites this phone is not for camera or gaming all stars for lightweight and sony experience

6659	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Purple)	xperia m is seriously an awesum mobile in low range but xperia c is best but little more costly than xperia m dual i purchased this phone in rs 12440 from ezeekart seller  original product delivered by amazon ezeekart
6660	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Purple)	overall ok they would have given a higher end processor for this cost now a days plenty of mobile manufactures are giving high end configuration for this rate however its worth for money since its a reliable brand
6661	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Purple)	good but as per order that cant be fully finalized by your vender take care for that in future for your customer for better service

6663	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Purple)	its very good handset in terms of value for money  the best part of this handset is the network connectivity i have tried with almost all sims that are available in kolkata for the first time this handset beaten nokias reputation in this matter  highly recommended for those who looks for a slim and handy android handset in dearer price
6664	Sony Xperia M (Dual SIM, Purple)	i have chosen this rating only due to the clean  fast service from amazon  i always like this online buying site due to its greater customer services specially fast connectivity to their customer supportsthough it has got slow a bit as compared to last 4 months or so  i always have been recommending amazon before my friends due to its complete service satifaction  hope it will be carrying on like this in the future as well  thank you amazon

6720	Xolo Q1000 Opus (Black)	hi all  delivery service is always best from amazon  performance of phone is too good for cost but there is functionality issues in phone  q1000 opus os do not support kitkat version if upgraded lot of malfunctions  mic the worst quality went to service center more than 3 times within these 10 days  suggesting to go towards brand phone buy instead of seeing cost walking to service center creates high frustration  thanks
6721	Xolo Q1000 Opus (Black)	within 45 months of buying this phone the display stop working gave it to the service center and was shocked to find out that they take atleast 30 days to repair handsets after trying to call their toll free no and sending 4 emails to their customer care and getting no replies i went and voiced my grievance on their facebook page received a replacement after 20 days was shocked to see that they had sent me a much older defective handset with the power key worn out and the speakerphone not functioning when dialling my voice could not be heard at the other end  returned it to them and still waiting to hear about the fate of the handset  i also discovered on their facebook page that several others have suffered the same problem they are using sub standard components and are unable to manage the after sales services  i regret having bought this phone and would not recommend to any wellwisher please see what others have to say on their facebook page search for xolo on facebook  apparently more than 4 people on this page have commented about their display getting spoilt
6722	Xolo Q1000 Opus (Black)	hi all when i received the phone it was seal packed and after opening it i tried to charging the battery but not was  connecting for charging it means company has packed without quality checked it means xolo company giving the message to all always  buy good brand product lenovosamsungpansonicand dont waste money in these type brandjinke pass product check karke rakhne ka time nahi hai bus adv karva lobut amazone service id
6723	Xolo Q1000 Opus (Black)	i bought this phone on 28 april 2014 upon the recommendation of a friend and after doing whatever research i could do  review in a nutshell lousy instrument  problems 1 within 2 days of beginning use things went wrong i took it to a nearby xolo dealer who said the os had to be reinstalled the backup of the contacts list failed to work and i lost all the contacts i had imported from my previous phone a nice good old nokia asha  2 within a couple of weeks after this the phone developed problems   a the blue tooth would not connect with my   i macbook pro laptop   ii bluetooth earpiece   b the data cable connection did not work so i could not transfer files between my macbook pro and the additional sd card i had installed in the phone  3 i took it to the authorized service centre we have to reinstall the os sir okay by this time i had found a way of backing up the data on google after the os was reinstalled   a the blue tooth connection problem persisted   b the front camera the one facing the user just disappeared as an option from the camera   c no matter which compass app i downloaded it just would not work  orientation error message of some kind   d the gps worked with google map app but not with anything else this is important because i need to use geographical apps for the geography education work i do with school kids which is one of the reasons that i bought this phone anyway   e the data cable still did not communicate with the laptop  4  on 27 june 2014 in the morning when i tried to switch the phone on it would not turn on it had died that is when i decided to take it to the authorized service centre  5 the service centre said the problems are too many and we have to send it back to the factory for repair or replacement it will take 25 days as of 27 june 2014 they also said that the company will not refund the purchase amount they will only repair or replace with another instrument the amazon returnbydate had expired so now i am stuck with getting a replacement instrument that i really have no interest in because i dont at all trust the quality of a xolo phone  6  amazonin has facilitated the sale of an utter dud of a telephone this is a serious black mark on amazonin  they are seeking to enter the indian market in a big way and want clearance from the government of india my experience with this purchase leads me to oppose granting of clearance from the gov of india  7  i am deeply dissatisfied with the quality of the phone i received and i am very very disappointed that amazonin would sell such a lowquality product  8  my inconvenience from the date i switched over to this phone has to be somehow addressed and redressed by amazonin i expect to hear from them within 7 days from today 30 june 2014 after which i will decide my course of action including complaining against both the manufacturer and amazonin to the consumer court  9  i do not recommend xolo to anyone i have actively dissuaded several friends from buying this phone this is a very very poor product  10  i will also not purchase merchandise from amazonin in the future if they do not respond to this review  11  i am forced to give this item some star rating  it deserves none since the amazonin site does not seem to allow me to not give a rating at all i have to click one star
6724	Xolo Q1000 Opus (Black)	the xolo q1000 opus was work fine for 2 days after that its given onoff or screen off button key issue for same visited ti thane service center teen hath naka where found the person  is not responding properly and mention the for key replace it will take 15 20 days  ti may go beyond 1 month also  these service center are more keen for handling the shopkeeper handset item  if any once go personally then they are not entertaining them  as same handset recycle in online or again to other shop keeper and sane was sold to new customer  i am thought that i had invested to wrong handset my investment in wrong asset  call center help line is also not good they cant provide any help  further i am unable to do any activity from my phone as screen lock is not able to open by button failure  if i go for replacement with amazon they already mention that it will take 715 days and refund will take 1 month to complete and credit in my account  in short 1 month money got block which was used by amazon for business use and full of harassment  finally from this experience i would say that t  purchase from any company shop with branded item which have good qc tested product for minimum issue  in case 1 piece defects comes that can be replaced by show room on the spot

6726	Xolo Q1000 Opus (Black)	q1000 opus has a broadcom quadcore cpunot the mediatek one which you see in other xolo device 1 gb ram is great for a device at this price range which ensures good multitasking and lag free user experience it ships with android 42 jellybean on board the processor is not that powerful when comparing to other xolo quadcore devices shipping with mediatek ones  display  5 inches the resolution is not that great only fwvga 480 x 854  196 ppi  the display doesnt look that bad though viewing angles are average the built quality of the device is also average  if you have seen official images of this device on xolo websitethere appears to be a compass photo in it in reality this doesnt have a magnetometerso no compass support accelerometerproximity and light sensor are included  this device has glonass in builtglobal navigation satellite systems developed by russia for better location tracking  the 5mp camera quality is average the video can be recorded at 720pbut the quality is below average the camera app has some bugs and often throws camera cannot be connected error you need to restart in order to use the camera again  1080p video playback is supported out of the box usb on the go is also supported with which you can plugin your usb pendrives and play multimedia files  popular games like temple runsubway surfers etc can be played without any issues the battery is a 2000mah one which can power it for 1 day of average use  apps can be movedinstalled on to the sdcard  i would very much suggest you to get other mediatek powered quadcore devices rather getting thisas they have overall better performance than this  update  xolo has released android 44 kitkat update for the devicemaking it a more value for money device

6753	Xolo Q1010i (Black)	i bought this handset and after using from 1 month battery is already bulged and i need to go to service center after paying so huge amount you should not give such kind of manufacture to sell the item on your protel  now your website does not make me return also  i am very much disappointed with the product

6761	Xolo Q1010i (Black)	this product from the house of xolo would have been best in class in mid range budget phonesif the battery backup of the phone was nice  pros camera is the best part of the phonethough its just 8 mp the picture quality is far more better in comparison with 13 mp cameras sony exmor r sensor imx135 5p lens with 20f supports otg carrying the phone would not be much of a problemas it light weight and sleek interface is basic and smooth need not buy any accessoriesas everything comes in the package otg cablecharger and data sink cableear phonesflipcoverscreen guard and the quality of the accessories provided are of remarkable quality  cons  battery back when used with 2sims and wifi onwith minimum usage gave a standby of 25 hrs till it ran down to 5 batterya better battery would have been better the phone take 3hours and 30mins to charge complety from 0 which is a very long time  battery is nonremovable stock android version 44 with some xolo preinstalled apps that glutton most of the battery those are to be disabled in the settings as it has single speaker the sound quality is faint in the back speaker  verdict not the best phone but good for those who love to take pics on the goyou must buy a power bank along with it if u are a regular traveler

6770	Xolo Q1010i (Black)	i have purchased it a month before but little bit disappointed because camera quality is not so good the feature which shows on website does not meet to the actual phone

6875	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	splendid awesome phone those who have used samsung note series may find the display little unappealing but unlike amoled screen this gives a more smooth views pleasing your eyes  1 gb of 2 gb ram is always free force closing clears upto 1546mb of ram thanks to the intel processor all other online retailers claimed 16 ghz z2560 processor but i got 2 ghz z2580 processor phone lucky me highly recommend thelapstore for their responses and support in product info  battery doesnt seem to be an issue for me as im not a heavy user data is blazing fast earphone quality is not up to the mark unlike samsung note series  you can control your speaker sound based on phone call  save mode  movies  music etc that is really sweet happy in every aspect except earphone call audio quality not worst but not upto the mark
6876	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	i have received the phone 16 ghz processor while on website it was mentioned 20 ghz i was very much disappointed
6877	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	pros excellent build qualitywish metal panel door was available as addon purchase brilliant ui probably the best 720p display on the market as of now color calibrationcolor temperature options are amazing natural colors wo any kind  of oversaturation  no lag noticed during regular usage surprisingly no heating issues on my zenfone 6 camera is bad definitely not worth the money i paid inbuilt call recording is way better than even paid apps on google play store  cons not a lightweight device loudspeaker volume is quite low even at max settings although quality of audio isnt  bad headphones provided with the device doesnt feel premium  but then the price isnt 34premium34 either not bad overall touch to wake is a simple software solution but asus lacked the common sense to include the feature
6878	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	i brought it offline but its by far the best phone i ever owned 2gb ram coupled with the dual core intel processorwith hyper threading technology ensures smooth performance no matter what you throw at it 16gbs of internal space ensures you always have space for that extra app you wanted on your phone just use a sd card for photos songs and other medias updated it to kitkat 442 and didnt regret it the ui became more impressive and stylish however after the update ive noticed ram usage have increased but the really wont matter the phone still handles most of the app from playstore due to intels hyperthreading technology some apps dont work on this phone but 999 apps work
6879	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	best phone in under 16000 category having all good features what most of the expensive phone dont have updated to kitkat upon receiving best zenui to use very smooth and fast access to all apps till date dont faced any issue with phone heads up to asus great product

6881	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	this is the awesome phone and really value for money just one thing i found is the processed which should be 2 ghz as per the specifications mentioned on amazon  i got 16 ghz here i am quite disappointed else the phone is really awesome
6882	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	nice phone superb touch experience but gets hot very soon  speakers also a bit low sounding
6883	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	it is one of the best phones ever for this price range its good

6889	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	a very good phone it is worth more than the price when compared to other brandsvery good phone
6890	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	the product though was delivered on time by amazon as always but some how it seems the products sold online are of sub standard within couple of weeks the phone has started giving lot of problems the touch is a problem the phone hangs and even normal games lag and are not smooth  after a month when the problem became more prominent i searched for service centre but unfortunately the near one was also 2 hrs from my residence  i called up the service center to understand what is causing the phone to malfunction i was asked to hard reset the phone by factory reset option by clicking the up volume key and power key simultaneously however the command was not working and i had to do a factory reset from setting option  the reset didnt help and the problems resurfaced after a week  and somehow i had to manage my time to visit the service center were the software was reup dated and it seems the phone has normalized however after couple of days the problems resurfaced i was completely disappointed and called customer service of asus and to my surprise the executives were really laid back and were not customer friendly they didnt even seem seem to have basic soft skills to deal with customers  after getting disappointed by call center i wrote to asus support but they sent a link which showed me the hard reset option which didnt work the last time however i still tried but in vain  i dont know what to do im disappointed as i cannot spend 2 hrs each side to visit the service center and then wait 3 hrs to get my phone reserviced  really dont know what to do with this phone  there are way too many problems more recent being the proximity sensor not working during incoming calls
6891	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	one of the best gadget  1 very smooth and top displsy even at bright sunlight display is quite brilliant 2 neat and clean build with volume rockers and power button on right side as well as pretty slim 3 every games are playable asphalt 8 with highest graphics with no lag at all 4 there are lots of inbuild apps from asus which are extremely useful and after updating those apps from play store t gives 1200mb of free ram 5 i got android 442 out of the box which can be upgraded to lollypop next month 6 i am using it for more than 10 days no lag  but the battery drains if games are played heavily it gets heated up if too much high graphics games are played 7 camera quality is average it has lots of modes but not such as for 13mp camera the front camera is well enough 8 display is large and hard to carry 9 the earphone is the best quality i play with google play music where every bits are clear and loud video player is very smooth and can play 1280p without any issues no need of mx player
6892	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	phone is good but some heating problem only other wise its to good
6893	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	is it equipped with 2ghz processor or 16 ghzas asus zenfone 6 india launched model has 16 ghz processorso is it imported one  as per your product info its 2ghz so is it 2 or 15 ghz 
6894	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Pure White)	like it but expectations are even much more at this price
6895	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	i have been using this smart phone since last one month and it gives me extremely good performance of all apps including longer duration calling this mobile wasnt being heated but one exception is rear camera not reaching up to the mark so whoever wanted to buy no doubt about it regarding performance

6897	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	wellthis is my second experience with intex smartphones and let me tell this phone is quite impressive with few cons but with the price range it is manageable pros octa core processor actually makes you feel the need of fast computingdont know if all the cores are used 1 gb ram is sufficient for multitasking though we have intex aqua speed that is loaded with 2 gigs of ram 5 inch ips display is good and satisfactory the reason i have deducted 1 star is camera13 mp doesnt feel really good 5 mp though is good for selfies battery drainage  ps if you are looking for a low budget smartphone with that many features  you definitely need to spec it once
6898	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	nice phone but cam flash and auto focus is so poor camera  quality is not bad front cam is so  poornot eligible for back 13 mp and front 5 mp in the camera quality  and phone speed is so fast applications and internet speed is so fast  and paying hd videos is good quality  i suggest buying peoplenot recommend in camera quality  best speed for internet browsing and gamingand entailment only
6899	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	i own this product and it is my review from usage of last 2 months the phone at the cost of rs7280 is exceeding my expectation i am pretty much satisfied with battery camera performance build quality of product i dont see any cons it is worth purchasing this product without any hesitation at this cost

6901	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	phone clarity good and value for money in this price but battery is not up to the mark
6902	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	its good with speed n battery also touch too smooth nice range from intex
6903	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	great phone for its price pros 1 good chipset media tek 8 core it is sightly underclock varient or standard mt6592 2 great build quality back cover feels soft to tooch 3 kitkat out of box 4 ok 13 mega pixel camera 5 dual sim gsm  cdma 6 protective case in box cons 1 so so battery lfe 2 vedio has lot of grain when shot 3 qhd is some what not suiltable for 5 inch device  but a great phone for its price performs better than redmi 1s must buy if you are very low on budget
6904	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	yesterday got my aquq i5 good product worth for the price13 mp camera is not that much stunning which i have expected but front cam is very good i orderd the phone for my wife and she is very happy and me too
6905	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	looks good  works good all in all happy 
6906	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	1 534 inch qhd ips display is really awesome 2 octa core processor at this pricing is unbelievable 3 dual sim both are gsm wcdma 3g speed is just wow 4 you can click photos from ongoing hd video recording 5 power saver profile is save your maximum battery only active those app which you are usingremain all are closed 6 13mp camera is over than my expectation selfie is awesome with 5mp camera

6912	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	battery life is averageback cover given by company was cracked in 3 days good phone
6913	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	phone is pretty good when you look at the specs but when you actually own it it turns out to be quiet a surprise phone hangs at places while playing games but just for a minute or two once you lock the screen and unlock it it works fine battery back up is terrible play games like asphalt 8 and t wont run for longer than 2 hrs but the display rocks movies will run for 5 hrs not too bad for the price but could have been better
6914	Intex aqua i5 Octa (Blue)	tooo bad internet connection  please giveme updates of this mobile
6915	Vivo X3S (White)	the aim of the review  is to help the searching people by providing accurate info i have tried it as a token of gratitude to contributing netgens since i am taking regular info from net  though  i am having  very limited time to contribute  the phone is having funos it is comparable to any launcher over android os it is customized to meet the requirements and  to give a wonderful user experience its dialer is ok  messages is having additional facility of sending vcard as an attachment  text better than old nokia facility the icons are beautiful pleasant legible colour combinations of icons over black wallpaper are excellent it is having imanager which is powerful enough to speed up  clean ram and close any installed apps it is having useful facility of white list so that it will not kill the apps included in the white list hence you may not need any rooting of the phone at all it is having only 1gb ram but no lag at all  alarm tone is natures sound  very pleasant ring tones are excellent selectable hifi mode cameras both rear  front are good good signal catching ring tone volume is ok at maximum level  probably vivo made so many customizations  refinements it  takes lot of efforts  time  to bring new versions like kitkatlollipop etc with the same excellent user interfaceandroid app short cuts  are installed on screen like ios hence  no app button in latest firmware version settings are similar to ios these are the changes with respect to stock  but it is fully compatible android probably they have aimed at ios like user experience with android flexibility  when it comes to audio quality most of the phones fail to impress audiophile  initially many of the users may not pay attention to audio quality so i have compared at equivalent volumes for both rmaa  subjective listening  the audio quality  of vivo x3s to many phones like iphone 4 it was reference to any phone in audio quality with flat frequency response low noise  imd very low output impedance in the range of 1ohm excellent stereo cross talk etc  iphone 4s  nokia e52 samsung a3 samsung s iii  usb sound card fiio e07  probably vivox3s is one of the best phone for bundled iem  16 ohm impedance ear phones iems  in audiophile point of view the frequency response is not as flat as iphone4but the difference is negligible 03db however fiio e07 with any android phone  with otg or pc usb tops the list and beats iphone 4 in every parameter even veteran nokia e52 performs very well far better than iphone 4 at equal volume level except in stereo cross talk vivo x3s supports native 441 khz playback which is also important for music fidelity it may be noted hifi is available only headphone mode in fact non hifi mode is also fared reasonably well the phone is bundled with excellent 16 ohm impedance iemearphone you may not need to purchase any additional iem earphone  headphone however if you are purchasing a phone with music listening as an important parameter please have a demo before the decision it is applicable to any audio device the latest  costliest need not be the best eg as on date many latest phones have native sampling frequency support for 48khz not for 441 khzsurprisingly all features of x3s are excellent except few limitations given below  however i have few reasons to root the phone 1 though it supports otg fiio e07 was not working as usb storage is implemented at another level however this can be fixed by app usb host check  if rooted the music quality of x3s is so high anything better may be beyond human hearing capacity or atleast negligible so fiio e07 may not be needed or unnecessary bulky 2 funos is desig is wonderfulstill one common  option of change of font size is missing though the existing font size is ok this can be fixed with bigfont app but it needs rooting i want larger size font to compensate my eye sight  which is at the manageable level 3 the in call volume level is normal at maximum setting but  i want little bit higher volume like moto g or razr m so i want to explore any possibility to increase the gain through rooting call volume booster app may used to keep in call volume to max in auto at the time of callingcall receiving 4 messages  is in conversation mode like all others android phones inbox  sent outboxdraftcustom folder are not available however pansi sms can be used but up to androidkitkat version as the developer stopped the development as on date  other limitations  deficiencies 1 clipping at 0000 is occurring 0000 has no meaning but error message is appearing during rmaa  even if specified line in  volume levels are set to calibrated value 2 it accepts 16 ohm impedance iem  load  very well but at 32 ohm impedance load  frequency response etc were lower than 16 ohms whereas  the sound  performance of other phones was better with higher impedance loads 3 notification led is not multi color only green 4 the length of the phone is high at 143 mm it is higher side for even for 534 screen i prefer phone length of less than 130 mm  but no hifi model is available with the lower length 5 fm radio sensitivity is poor compared to motog but approximately equivalent to nokia e52 very poor compared to stand alone radio  i am happy to say that i am unable to find any other deficiency in the phone as the date of review  downgrading  rooting vivo x3s it is shipped with firmware version pd1227bwexa270 which is not rootable with any of the available tools like kingoroot139 rootgenius187 iroot v185 hence the following method used to downgrade  root the following is the experience sharing for vivo x3s only please do not be confused with vivo xplay 3s it is a different model you are responsible for your actions never ever flash  update the rom not meant for that phone ie make model modelvariation etc are to be same  downgrade  1 put zip package firmware version pd1227bwexa1247  in phone internal storage important at present pd1227bwexa1247  or lower version are rootable firmware can be downloaded from httpwwwvivoglobalcomdownload5html 2 enter recovery entering the recovery mode  turn off your phone  hold and press the volume up key  power key together about 10 second  use volume keys to  shift 34selection34  on to  recovery mode  press power key to enter the recovery mode 3  use volume keys to  shift 34selection34  on to  wipe datafactory reset   press power button  now  shift 34selection34 to  user data yes  again through volume keys  press power button 4  use volume keys to  shift 34selection34  on to select wipe cache  press power button 5 use volume keys to  shift 34selection34 on  to  apply update from internal sdcard  press power key to select it  now select your zip package   depends where you put it 6 wait patiently till setup is complete  rooting  caution  risks involved i the built in counter of phone permanently records rooting info even if you unroot it  this will not reset hence warranty may be void in view of this rooting may not be advisable atleast before reliability of hardware is established as the risk lies with user advanced  willing  not with ms vivo it is a winwin situation as the vivo is not locking the os like ios or boot locked andoid by moto further the above downgrade method works only if phone enters into recover mode hence may not be suitable to bring back the bricked phonewhich may need different flashing method which is not known at present in view of this  vivo has done many useful tweaks rooting may not be required at all ii even if you rooted the phone never delete or even edit any system file or to that extent any file even if you have right tools  knowledge if not executed properly the phone may not boot after next restart iii if you select allow out of allow  deny for any program when asks for root permission on your rooted phonec  it means  you are giving administrative rights to that program  1 install usb drivers 34all mtk usb driver 2014 34 on windows pc may be googled to download 2 download and install any one of rooting tools like kingoroot13 or rootgenius18or iroot v185 i have used iroot may be googled to download on windows pc 3 open the application in pc  connect the vivo x3s to pc through usb cable  now on the debugging mode on phone  unlike other android phones  this option may not be available before connecting to pc however full developer mode can be accessible by dialing     7777     4 click on root  wait unroot option is also available at options of app phone will be rooted condition may be checked with root checker

6946	Lenovo A850 (White)	lenovo a850 is a mid range quadcore device priced around 15k  featurespros and cons  1 55 inch ips displaybut coming with a poor resolution 540 x 960 pixels  ie only 200ppi viewing angles are good though  2 this is powered by a mtk 6582m quadcore 13ghz processor which performs on par with the popular mtk6589 processor the gpu on board is a mali400 mp it performs better than the usual gpu powervr sgx 544mp seen in mtk6589 devices like micromax turboxolo 3000 etcgaming performance is great for the price  note  gsmarena lists this has a powervr sgx 544mp gpu which is an error gfxbenchmark website clearly shows it has a mali400 mp   3 1 gb ram which has now become a standard in 10k devices allows lag free multitasking  4 jellybean 422  not the latestbut still new and better than 41 jellybean im not sure whether this device will ever get updates to 43 or 44 no word from lenovo yet like any other lenovo devicethis too has a modified custom uiso not a stock android experience  5 battery  lipo 2250 mah battery which is good you can get around 2 days of average use with low brightness settings  6 camera  5 mp rear and vga front cam photo quality is not good  7 storage   you cannot move or install apps to the sdcardso you are stuck with around 2 gb of internal memory for apps and games installationwhich is not enough if you plan to install a lot of games  overall a good huge device with decent specsbut priced a little higher camera quality and internal memory are the key downsides of this device
6947	Lenovo A850 (White)	i purchased this product a couple of days back from a local shop in the exchange for my previous galaxy nexus which i had to change because of the battery backup i had to stick to a tight budget of 15k so i brought this piece and so far i am really happy with it the pros and cons are as follow  pros 1 the looks of the phone are very good 2 the built quality is superb overall the looks and the built makes it a premium device so no doubt there 3 the screen is big ie 55 inches surprisingly big for this price range 4 the mediatek mtk 6582m at 13 ghz performs too good beats all phones in below 20k range and some above 20k too for eg like galaxy grandboth mega 58 sony xperia c etc and i guess it equals xperia sp mediatek mtk 6582m performs better than mtk 6589 and even mtk 6589t and hence beats all mediatek powered local brand phones 5 benchmarks antutu   17100 quadrant  6001 and nenamark  full 60fps which is amazing 6 gpu is mali400mp2 which is certainly better than power vr sgx544 which is almost in all local mediatek powered phones 6 ram is 1 gb out of which you get 972 mb usable which is excellent there is well more than 600 mb ram free before installing apps 7 dual sim 8 sound is very loud and good not excellently clear but very load and reasonably clear and definitely audible 9 incall volume and clarity is good 10 music quality in my headphones is good i havent tested the stock headphones 11 comes with android 422 installed 12 memory can be expanded to 32 gb via micro sd card 13 nice and clearly visible notification led 14 lenovo launcher is highly customizable 15 pricing is very very good  neutral points  1 battery is good but not excellent i feel lenovo made a mistake by giving only 2250 mah battery to power such a huge screen it should have been atleast 2500 mah but nonetheless it still gives me a good 24 hours of battery life with 3g always on and mild  moderate usage should definitely last u through workday hours ie from morning 10 to evening 8 or something with moderate usage ultimately this depends on user to user one can use the provided lenovo power app to maximize the battery life 2 the speakers loudness sometimes tears the voice 3 the speaker at times gets covered by surfaces and blocks the sound i would blame the design of the phones for this 4 awkward positioning of buttons power button on top and volume button on the right 5 its fairly long time since 43 has released lenovo should give it out to its customers now this should have come with it  cons  1 camera is not good at all lens is not upto the mark bad decision of giving only 5mp of camera in these daysseriously who gives 5mp of camera nowadays front camera is just vga should haven been atleast 8mp rear and 13 mp on the front 2 too big its very very big a screen of 5 inches or even 53 inches like that of s920 would have been better 3 resolution is bad for this screen size as is said in the previous point a screen of 5 inches with this resolution would have been better 4 internal memory is just 4 gb out of which you get 207 gb for use i dont like this trend of giving just 4 gb of internal memory its too less for installing apps moreover you cant transfer apps to your sd card so you are stuck with 207 gb of space for apps unless you root should have been atleast 8 gb of internal storage 5 no gorilla glass  deducting one star for battery capacity and all cons  verdict  a nice tight budget phone with hefty performance and reasonably good battery lifewhich could have been better if you are on a budget of less than 17k then you should definitely close your eyes and go for it for brand freaks lenovo is a good reputable brand which you can trust on

7007	Lenovo Vibe X S960 (Silver, 16GB)	please note  this is not a review were you will find exaggerating claims about the wonders this product has done for me or those harsh feedback saying this was a completely useless product i find both very negative so if you would like to know what are the thoughts and experiences with this product kindly read on thank you  first things first  i was completely taken by surprise by this product i used to be a very brand conscious person i used a nokia c601 for around 4 years and also used a sony ericsson xperia x10 for quite some time both these phone during their days were kings and they served me really well my nokia sadly stopped responding to the touches i made to its screen making me finally settle on the decision to buy a new phone i never had been a crazy phone user yeah i do love cool phones come on i am 21 my friends keep changing their flagship phones each time something new comes out but i honestly like the desktop interface and large screen of my macbook to write and read my mails watch movies click random shots of the world around me specially when i can take out my camera i am a professional travel and fashion photographer edit my pictures giving them professional touches and finally see vibrant colors of my pictures but i always needed a more mobile platform to perform these function specially when i am on the move so i decided to get a proper smartphone that could really help me out as any ambitious mobile freak i searched for the flagships of the giants nokia samsung sony htc and all i could say was  out of my budget a bit disheartened i searched the midrange product of these very same brands again no luck the midrange simply miss out on either one or more from my essentials list not knowing what to do i decided to go with one of the midrange of any of the brands completely knowing i wont be happy thats when my dad said to look for lenovo the god in pc manufacturing i gave this brand a look i was taken away by the 4000 mah battery phones they really seemed surreal i searched further read reviews saw many complaints about the custom os and many other issues but still i decided to go ahead with this particular model vibe x having a feeling that it would be good and here goes how did it fare with me   1 its super thin very difficult to hold without a case i had to buy a nilkin leather flip cover for it from amazon itself but wait its the best phone to hold very light in weight and the laser carved design at the back has amazing feedback  2the os yes the custom launcher is heavy but that can be fixed by placing a more functional launcher like nova and it is upgradable to kitkat 44  3the hardware buttons are metal and have great touch  4the phone is fast specially after kitkat and nova but the ram gets clogged up fast this makes the phone fractionally slow making me to shut unnecessary apps and i am back to god like speeds  5the phone automatically switches to a know wifi network when i reach home or my workplace even when i didnt turn it on i havent used a newer android phone after xperia x10 so dont know if it exists in any but i found this very useful  6network reception is good 3g 2g all set call volumes are great the earpiece fixed speaker is a monster scary me everytime the phone rings sound is clear there is this feature were you bring your phone near to your ear when the phone is ringing and the call connects this cant be used in general mode because the speaker is at the earpiece and will permanently shut down your ear you can ever make a call to a person by opening their contact card and bring the earpiece close to your ear  7the screen is huge brighter and the colors are excellent and not over saturated like the samsung amoleds the details are really good the 440 ppi is a truth  8both the cameras are really good a bit soft at the back but after the editing it looked really sharp and free of noise  9the battery is a bit of a let down will definitely have to try some conserving tricks and invest in a power bank  10the otg doesnt seem to work hope we get a fix via a update because this becomes a serious issue its a 16 gb internal memory with no expansion and is the otg doesnt work we are in serious trouble lenovo seriously needs to fix this issues i actually settled for the non memory expansion phone hoping otg would work  otherwise its a amazing phone i really wished it was dual sim and had a bigger battery but its perfect i dont regret buying this product and a big thumbs up for lenovo for the hardwork they put in this product thanks for reading my review hope it helps psexcited about the k series from lenovo   lenovo you got a fan

7020	Lenovo Vibe X S960 (Silver, 16GB)	i bought this phone on 23rd may 2014 i was surprised by its features look and all the other things lenovo software team has added loads of additional packages over its base android i liked it for a while then the plethora of problem started  1 initially whatsapp was not working on 2g sim i neglected the issue at first as most of the places i had wifi connectivity it started working after 23 weeks or so 2 one fine day after 15 days phone hanged when i was having lunch finally i restarted it with a hard boot 3 exactly after one month it stopped switching on i submitted the phone at lenovo service center and it took almost 3 weeks for them to resolve the issue 4 i got the phone back and upgraded it to kitkat bam the problem was there again it was rebooting in every 15 minutes i submitted it again and they said it will again take 2 weeks more at the service center there were many people with similar problem definitely somebody has played a lot with android os here  at the time of writing this review my phone is still at the customer service center and i am yet to receive a reply from their end i trusted you a lot while buying this phone and you failed guys go for a brand it is always better lenovo software team has filled it with many crappy apps created by crappy coding given the opportunity i will definitely want to be their product manager and give them good coding lessons
7021	Lenovo Vibe X S960 (Silver, 16GB)	amazon side very good quick delivery  but the phone disappointed me its is hanging in some times mainly while using whatsapp after hanging it no more responding after 2 hours also even screen also doesnt off while hanging it is very typical to restart back cover open process is very typical camera wise very good
7022	Lenovo Vibe X S960 (Silver, 16GB)	prons  1 best look and feel 2 very slim 3 good battery life for my usage it is 2 days 4 good software addons by default 5 nice modification to android 6 cheaper for the configuration we get  cons  1 no nfc 2 received message get displayed on default screen need to make sure that someone cant see it

7024	Lenovo Vibe X S960 (Silver, 16GB)	i like lenova s960  very useful to me but small problem when message writing not working in enter button in that place smile cartoon symbols displayed i dont understand this
7025	Lenovo Vibe X S960 (Silver, 16GB)	system font are in chinese to fix that you have to change the rom  if you will install any custom rom then you will lose service support 
7026	Lenovo Vibe X S960 (Silver, 16GB)	really an awesome gadget  im using it for the last 6 month  no complaints yet  handy design power will drain out  quickly on 3g
7027	LG-295 L FINO (BLACK-TITAN)	internal memory is a issue 4gb is not sufficient all other feachers are good overall the phone is ok
7028	LG-295 L FINO (BLACK-TITAN)	i have purchased lg l fino dual  and i am satisfied with the features it is offering
7029	LG-295 L FINO (BLACK-TITAN)	i bought this phone lg l fino d295 on 10012015 i am not able to find some basic features which are mandate for a smartphone above 11k  1 no notification light for charging  low battery  full charge 2 no notification lights for messages  missed calls  3 as of now there is no guarantee whether this phone will be getting upcoming android updates inbuilt android version of lg l fino is kitkat 442 whereas kitkat 444 is latest one  4 yesterday  i checked for latest software update it showed that software update kitkat 444 is available even after successful updation of software  i observed that my phone was still showing old android version ie kitkat 442   5 cannot keep camera shutter sound on silent mode  6 only panorama option for clicking photos  no night scene landscape document etc is available  it is my humble request to all lf l fino users to share views opinions incase you have a solution to above highlights  one of the best feature that i observed on this device is 34vibrate on call connect34  if we call a person and heshe answer our call  immediately we will receive a vibrate which is a sign that our call is answered
7030	LG-295 L FINO (BLACK-TITAN)	ive purchased this product from market in a much higher price but i would like to purchase it from amazon other then this it is the best smart phone ive ever used in this range i would personally suggest that if you are buying your first smart phone and dont want to own an apple or black berry or then you should go for this as its unique in itself and has its own style and class with lots of such amazing features which only lg can provide it contains 1 gb ram but supports all the games in such a way that you will love this phone further its design with sound key at back is something which attracts you at the first look as the idea was brilliant to do so  ive rated it 4 star due to the extra cost which i have to pay for this item however if the item was available at this price i would like to give ti 5 star

7065	Panasonic P51 (White)	received mobile box in tampered condition on opening was shocked phone is already used by someonesomemany for more than  8 months phone was already registered with email id 3434 all phone contacts messages etc everything can be seen  what a disappointment totally frustrated by amazon service i am going to take amazon on consumers rights forum and will take definite action against this act of fraud  dear people be aware of such acts by amazon products you purchase no guarantee that is new
7066	Panasonic P51 (White)	dont buy panasonic it is cheap rebadged chinese phones panasonic does not manufacture mobiles hopeless nonexistent service i had brought a p51 which went dead in 10 days it took panasonic 45 days to give me a refurbished phone with scratches and no spare phone either later found the phone was rebadged from chinese brand tvl waste of time and money do your research before buying this phone
7067	Panasonic P51 (White)	good phone the sound coming from the speaker was very low i called customer care who were very helpfull and gave me details of service centres in my city for fixing the problem i visited the service centres who said that there was no problem with the phone and could not fix the problem accidentally my friend found that the low voice is due to blocking of speaker by sticker pasted backside of phone and removal of the same solved the problem
7068	Panasonic P51 (White)	its a good looking mobile slim and better than all the chineese mobiles the display is just great pure android but after 6 months of use sometimes the camera does not open and you have to restart the mobile to free memory otherwise it does everything i need
7069	Panasonic P51 (White)	this phone is a complete waste of money panasonic service is really pathetic i hardly used it for 5 months and since then it is lying with the service center of the panasonic and they never attend any of your complaints
7070	Panasonic P51 (White)	i got that phone but its seems like second hand phone why amazon sell this bad productsits flip cover also seems bad like used oneam so disapointed plz make sure that giving  better products
7071	Panasonic P51 (White)	speaker  of the phone is very very bad otherwise ok batterycameraheadphone very goodlook also goodflip cover also niceamazon delivery really very good
7072	Panasonic P51 (White)	the instrument is excellent but only the negative point is low voice the volume is not sufficient for skype or any musical files listening etc
7073	Panasonic P51 (White)	panasonic p 51 mobile is  as like as china mobile sound quality is very cheap full sound like silent phone  amazon is cheap online company  pls go to the flipcart  other company
7074	Panasonic P51 (White)	i really have lot of trust on amazon to send me the valued and trusted product and the result comes true when i received my product safely thanks to amazon and its team
7075	Panasonic P51 (White)	verygood mobile highly satisfied features except headphone loudness can purchase without any hassitation
7076	Panasonic P51 (White)	i have been using this phone from the past 20 daysworthy to buyi keep playing ashpalt8 game gaming performanceear phones quality  are also good
7077	Panasonic P51 (White)	surprisingly it is not as popular as it should be compared to other brands in the same range it is upto my expectations
7078	Panasonic P51 (White)	yes have purchased p51 and happy with the phone the phone quality is very good but battery is not at par as claimed the phone looks like more than 25000 smart phone performance and look wise its also good and eye catching one should consider to buy it without any hasitation
7079	Panasonic P51 (White)	prostop notch build qualityexcellent displayvery good battery back upperformancecameraall rounder
7080	Panasonic P51 (White)	i bought this phone not through amazon back in september 2013 i feel its a very good value for money phone to buy if you are on a budget but beware people who run repair and service centres both authorized and unauthorized say that spare parts for this phone are not usually supplied in enough quantity and on time by jaina marketing the same company that markets the karbonn range of phones so those customers whose panasonic phones break down have to suffer a lot i myself had to place an order online with a singapore based exporter for a new display for my p51 after leaving my phone for 40 days at the authorized servicecumrepair shop in my hometown jaina marketing failed to supply the screen for this model so theres nothing this guy running the servicecumrepair shop could do about it i inquired at a few unauthorized centres but all of them told me the same thing panasonic p51s screen is unavailable in the market i finally found relief when i received the shipment from singapore and then i had my p51s smashed screen replaced for rs1000 although the overall cost was rs6700 this sad episode led me to think that buying this phone is a tricky affair you get great value for your money but god forbid if your phone breaks down you may face a very difficult time getting it fixed
7081	Panasonic P51 (White)	good mobile only one  negative charging point position its really bad idea because if you  use  flip cover  u unable to close flip cover when u r using charge
7082	Panasonic P51 (White)	horrible company is panasonic  there is no proper after sales service the service center people are illiterate i would never recommend to buy panasonic to any one of my known
7083	Panasonic P51 (White)	i even got jbl speakers free as a surprise gift 97869786128525128525128525
7084	Panasonic P51 (White)	its camera is so slow

7108	Xolo Q1100 (Black)	this is the mail  i have purchased my handsetq1100 before around 4 months just to remind you that this handset is faulty from the date i purchased and problem is that i can not communicate over my cell properly and sometimes its too annoying for me to handle some conversation i ignored this problem initially but now its getting bigger and bigger day by day i think the problem is with gps receiver or it could be anything  my question to you is have you solved this problem or not if yes then i can send my handset to you or if its no then you should focus on the existed customer because by advertizing on tv you will get nothing learn from xiaomi or many others  the reason behind direct contacting to you is my friend got the same handset with same problem and he had gone to one of nearest customer care in ahmedabadgujarat after one month i think its too much for anyone to solve the problem he got his handset back with same problem so if you are doing this kind of cheating with customer then there is no point for customer care thats why i am asking you prior that if you are capable of repairing this handset then only i should send mine  the other problem is battery life i have to say that you are not living up to customers expectation there are so many models out there which are well and cheaper than yours  please reply me as soon as possible with some good news so that i can enjoy my rest experience with xolo  here are some information about my handset for your clarification imei
7109	Xolo Q1100 (Black)	have not faced a single issue with the phone the display might not be the highest resolution but its still pretty clear

7111	Xolo Q1100 (Black)	i choose it because it has great look great features and according to this price cell broadcasting messages is harrasing upto 50 to 60 msgs per day receiving  dont know how to stop this other than this its good phone
7112	Xolo Q1100 (Black)	superb phonefor this cost no other brand will give this type of configuration iam very happy with the phonenegative point is if you want listen music speakers sound is low
7113	Xolo Q1100 (Black)	recently i purchase this gadget here are the few drawbacks 8226sound quality is low 8226when mobile data connected and trying to take snaps sometimes message says unfortunately canes not supporting  8226cell broadcasting setting are not supported to turn off and on 8226 unfortunately i got damaged headset
7114	Xolo Q1100 (Black)	third class item motherboard blew off in just four months service pathetic service center was full people crying they took almost a month to rectify the set now no warranty available so expecting phone to work for another four month and then find a place in thrash or may be toddler will play with this in our society downstairsbetter to buy any cheap phone than to waste 12k on this lousy product

7121	Xolo Q1100 (Black)	the mobile is good in its style looks and elegancescreen hd quality is great but the negative side is thatafter even 15 min of use for gaming or net connectivity it is heating up like anything and temperature of battery is crossing 4045 degree centigradeother wise the product is awesome in its price range and is the fastest mobile that i have ever seen

7127	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	it was an awesome experience with amazon i got this mobile with screen guard and till the time it is working superb when i went in mobile shop to put screen guard the owner of the shop asked me to check if it is a genuine product i was in surprise that why he said like that i questioned him about this and he answered that there are some korean clones in the market and it looks similar to the samsung galaxy s4 mini i was worried about it and found something interesting about the codes which i tried on my mobile and had a relief that it is genuine one   if you want to buy something fast and superb go with this one with my one day review   1234 view sw version pda csc modem 0 general test mode  12580369 sw  hw info  197328640 service mode  0228 adc reading  32489 ciphering info  232337 bluetooth address  232331 bluetooth test mode   if these codes are working then it is an original one
7128	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	it worth the money spent  i was ready to go to a higher featured even if more expensive than this phone  if that is having a dual sim option  but i found this is the only phone available in market with dual sim and reasonably good features but it worth the money spent  if you are looking for dual sim phone  go for it  if dual sim is not your concern you have plenty of options available 
7129	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	this is a best phone i came across from samsung only small issue is phone gets heat up while accessing net or applications but this seems to be a problem with every smartphone
7130	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	samsung s4 mini is a near perfect phone in size and features been using this for more than a week and i am loving the phone  what is good  ideal screen size of 4334 42 would be perfect  dual sim  256 ppi very good resolution  light weight just 110 gms  15 gb ram  ir port ir remote useful in public places where is a tv good app  8mp camera with full hd video recording  1900 mah battery  android 422 up gradable to 442  what not so good  phone heats up while charging  takes a very long time to charge compared to s4  slightly lags not a major concern  battery backup average expected better results  no network issues till now works flawlessly easy to handle and can be operated in a single hand though the phone has 15gb ram it lags sometime i think kitkat update should fix this games works fine if samsung launch s4 mini in google play edition with single sim it would be a dream phone bloat software taking up space and eats battery decent photo  video quality  this phone in my opinion is value for money best phone in sub 20k category  overall good buying experience
7131	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	it is a good phone there have been many reviews giving pros and cons so i wont spend time doing the same overall i am satisfied with it so far but video playback 25 at this price point you dont want a non sense phone that cant play video flawlessly amazon delivery is super fast thanks to amazon
7132	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	small and very light weight definitely for people who cant afford iphone which is small and light weight too battery is decent resolution is good looks like a completely miniatured s4 phone is very fast no lag at all the texture on the back cover looks a bit cheap
7133	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	the worst  sammy i ever used my previous was s2 and no doubt it was the best samsung 3yrs back recently ditched it for a lumia after all the battery and lagging issues os experience 5050 and battery life was miserable you get 78hrs on 75 use compared to an iphone 4s having 1430mah battery what i liked was the amoled screen again no 720p another part is the slim design with faux panel addition which again is a fake plastic imitation of faux leather let down by low pixel count and horrible heating issue i think normal users will surely ditch this phone camera was on par compared to sony or lenovo better options are moto x if your an android lover sony zr for better camera and lumia 1320 for a phablet experience with a huge battery life no doubt here better atleat compare s4 mini before buying it
7134	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	pros    solid camera with great video recording   overall performance is decent for a midrange phone   easy and comfortable to hold  cons    display could be better   priced too high for intended audience   limited internal storage
7135	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	operating system android 42 is doing well but the call logs of individuals should be clubbed and not shown separate records this is the only shortcoming of the os hope i can upgrade the os
7136	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	great value for money nice looks perfect size good fit and finish till now no problems should have included an additional usb cable in the kit now we need to disconnect the one from charger and use
7137	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	the features are good but sometimes the phone gets overheated the battery is not that great as well this would be an average phone for this price considering the features and the battery
7138	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	pros good and bright display small and light weight didnt see any lag while playing games perfect size and looks awesome dual active sim can get calls from both the sims as well as can have 3g on one of the sim nice camera  cons battery back up pricey compared to moto e ideally we should not compare but with 70 similarities 17k  7k currently working on andriod 42  flawless transaction from amazon and delivered before the estimated delivery5 to amazon
7139	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	excellent phone brought many things from amazon till date like mixer phones bags etc happy with all as of now good and prompt service from the amazon team
7140	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	very happy with the product as i expectedthe features are really impressiveit is user friendly phone for everyone thanku for the feedback given by others
7141	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	a nice phone  perfect size great screen resolution takes good photos great battery life on the cons its not great for gaming due to frequent lags the phone tends to heat up and hangs altogether so exercise caution when using it extensively or while playing games it doesnt seem to handle continued use very well overall  not bad at all a quad core processor would have been a big plus for this piece
7142	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	i was really impressed with the features it serves all my requirements i am happy that i can use one of the sim slot for data while other is used for calling and i can do it at the same time unlike other mobiles i considered buying  the major downside is battery life i hardly get a day backup considering that fact that my usage is high always have 3g or wifi turned on
7143	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	mobile is amazing but there is too many samsung apps which covers lots of space and secondly i heats very fast
7144	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	nice phone with a very nice camera and screen the phone is comfortable enough to sit in my pantshirt pocket it has not had any problems after 6 months i am not a heavy phone user the only problem is the pathetic battery life even with my light to moderate use i have to recharge the phone every 24hrs
7145	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	it is a good phone there have been many reviews giving pros and cons so i wont spend time doing the same overall i am satisfied with it so far the delivery of the phone had some problems and it was delayed by one day amazon didnt refund the fees they charged for expedited delivery
7146	Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini GT-I9192 (Black Mist)	i think i chose the wrong product it isnt performing too good went to service station to repair the frequent restart to which they adviced me to change the battery and so i did however its the same anyway u can fool someone only once hence will not buy any samsung product
7147	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Champagne Gold)	just by the looks of it everyone is at awe for this product the gold color adds to it classy luxury looks begin a 6 inch display the device is a behemoth but when you open it up and start using it its silky smooth and no nonsense phone the zen ui is different from the stock android ui so it will take some time to understand wheres what inside the phone given the price of 16k this device is just right among the mid budget variants offering good features for the buck i have a lumia 925 lumia 930 and a lenovo z2 pro and by the looks the asus still catches my eye the other reason to purchase the device is because asus hardware is being used by big companies like google to build their devices so you cannot go wrong on the hardware front when such big corporate are trusting their repo on this company
7148	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Champagne Gold)	very good phonevalue for moneyi am very happy with amazon for delivering my order before timethe packaging was goodthe most important part is that phone specifications given in the website matches means i received my phone i advice people to have the zenfone its a very good phone
7149	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Champagne Gold)	speakers are of not good quality low in sound to talk as well as even during ringing not suitable to listen to music at all phone is of larger size difficult to handle with one hand other than that all other features are amazing

7152	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Champagne Gold)	great phone for this price smooth performance and great looks
7153	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Champagne Gold)	phone is good but camera quality is not good as compared to other 13pixl camera mobilesflash is also not helpful in dark for picturesdid not meet my expectation htc in same range would have been a better choice
7154	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Champagne Gold)	very nice phone
7155	Asus Zenfone 6 (16GB, Champagne Gold)	im using it from 2 weeksthis phone is very good  pros 1 battery backup is too goodim heavy user and the battery comes for abt 2 days 2very crisp and vivid display 3sound quality is also good 4camera is awesome as u get 13mp with pixel master technology  cons 1 only the ringing volume is a bit low and for music lovers the sound isnt that great

7183	XOLO Q1011 (White)	i am not satisfied with this product 57 times restart in a day xolo care service is not good so many times call to customer care but no reply and i send the sms to given number but not response from xolo care  amazon service is good

7295	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	i bought this phone for my dad expecting just a good screen but as compared to other phones in the marketits below expectations a few things are34 bad touchscreen lack of features its hard to find softwares for this os lacks home button hangs a lot even in opening whatsappthen you need to restart idk if it can handle multiple apps  there a few goods too  good camera in this range led flash in this range is hard to findand its good battery backup is finecompared to other smartphones  verdict this was a good phone  but not any more with other phones recently launched in market this phone is now lying idle in my homeas i bought new asus zenfone 6000 it was 100 times better than asha 502 sorry nokiayou were my favourite brandplease give us options to stay loyal that too with competitive rates
7296	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	i brought this for my brother and for his needs its a amazing product from nokia the lower version asha 230 also i ordered fro my dad
7297	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	go for it if you need just a cute phone which have all the basic functionality  camera is okay with its flash and 5 mp size the fast lane and swipe oriented interface are pretty good to work with battery lasts for almost 2 days small enough compared to other smartphones cannot call this a smart phone actually this is a phone which is not dumb charging time is very less  display quality is very bad clipboard not present not enough apps in the store they havent made a pc suite which is compatible with this phone but there is an option to export the contacts to the memory card for back up purpose
7298	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	sorry my experience with the product is not good  may be because this is a window phone it does not give the services the other smart phone give  i have a nokia lumia n520 which is a better product
7299	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	the phone is good for a normal user who is not interested in fancy applications i bought it for my father who just talks and sometimes sends messages  one downside is the internet experience on the phone and camera quality which are average at most
7300	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	likd the product bt colour of headset is not good it comes in bright red colour it doesnt suit the product
7301	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	not good at allhangs a lot of timeit gets hanged many timesand never buy phone online and even its name  asha is not good
7302	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	as a nokia user thought nokia asha would stand out exceptionally as i was gifting one to my dad however i used it for a trial run before giving it for 5 hours it turned out that the phone super sluggish and it lags so i would only recommend you to buy only if you need to otherwise you will be better off buying an android phone over a falling s40 phone cheers 
7303	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	i bought this phone for my dad i wanted a budget phone with a decent camera and a user friendly operating system the most important app for anyone in mumbai is mindicator as a mumbaikar that is the only thing i missed in this phone the phone is great for basic use otherwise good value for money

7309	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	good budget phone with basic entry model features enough to make calls got this for my parents they are happy with it so i guess it was a good buy
7310	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	the phone sometimes becomes dead i have to remove the battery and reinstate the batter the phone starts after that only do not buy this phone
7311	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	its not a good phone at all u cant install a variety of apps u can get a good phone at this price

7314	Nokia Asha 502 (Dual SIM, Black)	nice product at this price by nokianow there are better products at this price

7316	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	well the product specification seems quite good at the price i bought but it does not give what it promises processor is quite good good screen size and resolution let me clarify why it is fraud 1 it promises 5 mp camera but it is worse than vga camera of some other mobile 2 flash is just for show doesnt make any difference at all 3 tried to contact customer support provided in warranty card but most of the number in fact all the number i tried were fake and was not able to contact any one  really really bad customer support
7317	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	the phone is cost efficient except the camera which does not meet upto 5mp standard and flash which can be used only as a torch
7318	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	dont buy any karboon mobile    i have used 3 karboon mobile from last two years that my experience told pros good looking  cons 1   after 23 month will give u something problem in hardware 2  not good service even in mumbai like city 3  small problems also took 2 to 3 month for servicing 4  in service they will create another problem 5 more of warranty period goes to servicing even more than half of warranty period thats why 6 they cheat with good design 7 dont buy any karboon mobile they r wast of mony  time
7319	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	the apps are running good but the cameras lens is poorit is 5 mp but at night it is worst than 2 mp

7323	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	it is working perfectly till date no problem battery back up is more than 2 days with continuous use good reception as well
7324	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	this is good mobile in this price  and im satisfied with this phone but the camera quality in not good as they said
7325	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	it gives me a internal memory of only 130 mb which is worst and battery backup is so bad camera and flash are useless
7326	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	it was good but didnt satisfied me the touch quality was not up to mark and the phone hangs so many times
7327	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	camera quality is worst flash can be use as torch light only but in this price range phone is overall good
7328	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	overall decent phone at the price good solid plastic but within 2 months of purchase the screen started showing discoloration and a line started appearing service center guys have given a timeline of 342 months34 for repair under warranty  so essentially it is unusable for me
7329	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	delivery by fedex courier is very fastlook wise karbonn a6 is gud but the battery backup is poor and often gets heated at the backsideeventually battery drips downsound is good incoming call speaker is of low sound need help to locate the service centre at vizagprice is good
7330	Karbonn A6 (Black-White)	very poor qualityback camera is 5 mpbut the power is less than 1 mpwe can not get clear picturein built memory is very lesseventhough we use additional memory card it does not functioncusomer service is very poor

7338	Sony Xperia J ST26i (Black)	it is one of best xperia phones with killer looks if anyone has budget less than 15k then he should definitely go for this phone
7339	Sony Xperia J ST26i (Black)	this phone worked awesome for the first six months but it started irritating me thereafter the touchkeypad had problems in one alignment line from top to bottom near the right hand side of phone where the letter i is there in qwerty after six months the problem shifted to greater width of touchscreen which i can clearly see on the sony diagnostics moreover touch has started getti way insensitive and it doesnt seem like phone works on 1ghz clock speed  a sad buy havent got the set serviced yet but its good that problem crept in warranty duration please go for better gpus and rams you may get at a price lesser than that of j  comparison with cheaper phones samsung s duos which you can buy for lesser price has same specifications same ram phone memory gpu clock speed processor type etc but it has better performance that this for greater age  pros battery life way way good practically double than that of samsungs and htcs for same rate camera obviously sony has to deliver it  cons lags irresponsiveness to the extent that you cannot write on a vertical screen you have to rotate it everytime making it lite doesnt help

7352	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, White)	phone with good price and  good performance
7353	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, White)	the sony xperia e c1504 is very good
7354	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, White)	good smartphone but a bit slow
7355	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, White)	good buy for for around 6000
7356	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, White)	good budgeted phone
7357	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, White)	very very nice
7358	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, White)	touch is not very good which reduces overall experience it has started deteriorating further may be some problem with handset rather than model free headfone are great complimentary
7359	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (White)	the phone is better in looks than samsung also android interface is properly customized as compared to nexus and moto g  it is good buy but sony is always costly than samsung but better in build than samsung
7360	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (White)	its been a few weeks since ive been using the phone the phone looks an feels more premium than other brand models in the same range packs in a bundle of features processor ram and screen are more than sufficient for all my needs battery life is also pretty good overall an excellent buy
7361	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (White)	first of all thanks to amazon  got it fast and packaging was good toothia was my first purchase from amazon and i am happy from their service  now about the mobile its my first sony mobile too had samsung mobiles earlier but they hanged very much but this mobile is power packed  have a look at this  1design  very nicely designed  attractive looks so 910 2performance  well the phone is very nice never hangs even i you are a hardcore gamer  this phone can run all the games smoothly because it has adreno 320 gpu 3software  the phones comes with android 412 which can be upgraded to android 43 which is not a problem for me because almost all apps work on 43  4battery  battery is good and has stamina mode which disables data connection when we lock screen but even when it is not on the battery lasts long 5camera  camera is 8mp but it seem it could have been a little bit better but doesnt have much problem  you can buy a camera for good pictures so i recommend this product to everyone must buy it meets all the needs of people
7362	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (White)	there was a small scratch on the screen which according to me was the major drawback how could a mobile phone with a scratch resistant and gorilla glass display have a scratch while packed in the box please try to be a little more careful regarding this and if possible try to rectify my problem other than this the mobile phone is worth the money spent
7363	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (White)	the phone is a piece of art with so many other phones there were released after this model the reason you can still go for this is its style factor the notification light strip at the bottom is a killer   this 17 gig dual core performs well with games like temple run and subway surfer phone functions well without any lag so far the 8 mp camer is great it even has a camera button that works like a real camera button allowing you to half press to focus and then full press for the click the camera flash has a fill light option which provides for a soft lighting when you would otherwise avoid flash there is no news of upgrade from sony to kit kat for this phone although custom roms are available   overall its a great phone to own if you want a premium looking phone which is a style statement in itself although may not be running the latest version or may not be part of the multi core wars
7364	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (White)	i would say the best phone in its segment also in budget and not expensive like those higher range phones the best part is it has all those premium features which probably a higher range phone has and at any moment you will not feel that it is a mid range phone
7365	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (White)	got this for my mom she says its a bit heavy but its great she is not techno savvy but she does know to use whatsapp and fb and pay bills with the phone and use it as wifi hotspot and play the songs my dad want on you tube she likes the pics she click and the music player i her to have 8gb internal so chose this over xperia c or m all in all perfect mid range phone from sony
7366	Sony Xperia SP C5302 (White)	i ordered the sony sp 24th  oct at amazon and they delivered me at 9th nov delivery is to late but about sony sp is a very good phone i am using this phone from last10 days phone looks good processar is very fast for gaming and all there is no any lag in this phone and camera is also a very good only one problem in this phone heating problem

7440	Micromax Bolt A37B (Black)	we wanted i smartphone at a reasonable  it filled the bill perfectly wish the instructions were more simple   detailed would recommend it to anybody who wants to buy an android at an honest price raj aurora
7441	Micromax Bolt A37B (Black)	its a best phone for this rate but it is not suitable for the gamers even candy crush also hangingmore then that it has 3g wifi duel sim and other higher end phones option and also main another drawback is its phone memory its very low only few apps can run for the basic users who want full features its suitable for them
7442	Micromax Bolt A37B (Black)	i bought this micromax bolt a 37 red colour there is defect in software touch screed often gets stuck we need to go to home page and come to menu page each and every time back option sometimes does not work properly while attending a call you cannot delete a number if you have wrongly entered the number you have to cut and new entry each time during hold  this phone is not user friendly bit slow that s why they give it for half of the price while buying i wondered why they were giving it 3500 instead of 6000 inr  if you put another 2000 rs you will get higher end phone with 1 gb internal memory and 1 gb ram
7443	Micromax Bolt A37B (Black)	bought my new phone and got to know all the hindi text messages are getting messed up  contacts also have problems

7507	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	firstly i am a bb fan so wanted to own one and its my first bb so bought it from amazon as usual amazon service has been great in delivery  though i am a fan of bb there are few cons to it as well  pros tutorials for every feature that can be used in bb 10 is a treat for new bb holders awesome display and design is goodgenerally bb mobile screen looks small but this mobile doesnt disappoint us regarding big screentouch experience touch is too good typing experienceno need to say about bb keypad i guess is too good which is one of my major requirement as i am not a touch freaki wanted a qwerty keypad mobile which this one served very well voice  music clarity is awesome emailsdocuments on the go is a treat individual profiles creation for office or work emails is awesme and security wiselocking applications with passwords is also it serves the best  cons battery drains and switches off the next morning if its below 40 over the nighti have expected for 24hrs of standby atleast with internet on but without internet just for calls too its the same case camera in low light conditions its bad exposure if sufficient light is there it serves the purpose fb in bb is the worst ever it doesnt work as expectedfb update for bb is very much required apps in bb is a down side as everyone knowthey arent free  though it is known i wanted to go for it as i love its design of qwerty keypad  overall a mixed bag of experience with my bb smart phone 
7508	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	the best of both worlds bought it after doing tons of research  previous phone was a samsung galaxy note used it for a good 2 years and i can tell you that i will never go back to a samsung again ever this time i wanted a phone that felt like a phone my fav phone of all time was my old nokia e71 it was slim solid built to last everything was a click away needed only one hand to operate and did everythin u wanted a smart phone to do basically i use my phone for connectivity sms calls emails social networking browsingin addition a decent camera an occasional game so it was decided that i wanted to go back to a qwerty and the best qwertys these days are made by bb so did my research took the plunge and boy am i glad  like all the previous reviewer said if what you need from a phone is connectivity look no further than this  pros 1that keyboardwork of artanyone who loves a physical keyboard will absolutely trip on this 2great call quality a given when it comes to bb 3you tend to get reception anywhere never out of rangecompared to my old samsung 4the battery although not close to the legendary micromax it trumps all the other smartphones esp samsung and apple easily lasts for more than 36 hours with continuous 2g occasional wifi on 5the bb10 os very fresh very new and feels great to have when every other phone out there is an android or ios 6decent camera have taken some pretty good pics good video capture too capable of 1080p 7very good and loud speakers 8great form factor feels good and solid in the hand the back cover offers great grip no chance of slipping 9best of both worlds qwerty  touch 10very fast processor no hang no freeze no auto restarts everything is a breeze  cons really cant think of any coz this phone gives me everything i need from it do not buy this phone if your priorities are playing games watching movies etc get this if what you need is a serious nononsense smart phone that you can really depend on and get a tab for the rest  the bb10 os is a pleasure to use has infinite number of gestures and keyboard shortcuts a month up with the phone and still learning remember to go through the online tutorials plenty of em out there
7509	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	the best phone one could ever have with in this price range be it sending emails browsing net or accessing social media this phone does it in a flash of a second i am not a big fan of touch screen phones with movie hall sized screens and mega pixel cameras that can shoot a full hd movie with a very decent camera rear  front the pictures that you take using q10 can compete with any other phone in this range in terms of quality bb 10 is such a fantastic upgrade from the earlier versions and it makes almost every possible function using this phone a cake walk this is for users who want to think out of the box and bored of damaging fingers with typing on touch screens and who prefer comfort than style i wanted to wait till the release of blackberry passport but i kinda accepted the argument by a bb user in an online forum that 34never pay a premium for newly launched phones and cars34 wait till a year the price will be half and most of the technical bugs are fixed my q10 is manufactured in june 2014 and i can move to passport after 23 years and until then i will be completely in love with this excellent device which has all the features i look for in a 34professional34 phone but still can be a good companion in my personal life as well the price at which i got this wonderful product through amazon with warranty can never be matched by any retailer and i can understand why all these goons are up in arms against amazon
7510	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	while there is a lot of improvement in this model compared to my earlier model i thought  with the bb link sw  transfer of atleast my contacts would be a cake walk this time but i was for a big shock when all my contacts were showing up in duplicates of 46 each and there was no way to clean it up nowhere on the web could i find a solution to this problem except for a factory reset  the deleting the duplicates one by one which vv tedious my other phone which i changed from a s to another of the same make restoring the contacts was really a cake walk in that in fact this  many other cheap phones now give the file of contact in a editable file which is vv easy to edit  restore i am sorry that such a technologically advanced co doesnt have a solution to this simple problem the other shocking aspect is that there is no helplinesupport tel no no  email nothing for giving support to customers in the bb website the only 2 options are a forum  twitter i dont have  dont want a twitter also  so there was no way of contacting bb to get support they must be ashamed
7511	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	the name is blackberry   got a 4g version sqn0003 with 15 years manufacturer warrantybrand new sealed packthe seller smart oye is really smart indeed got the phone delivered in my remote district within 2 working days the q10 is really some phone buy it and feel what its like to hold a power house in your hands dont compare a premium blackberry device to some mundane cheap plastic chinese phonesthose who does such comparisons are mediocresas the adage goes 34android is for the mass blackberry is for the class34
7512	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	guys please dont go to blackberry phones i was a great user of blackberry for the corporate mailing data usage webex meetings scheduling meetings etc but the latest phones with 102 or 103 there is no service from blackberry and also the next version of software will not be upgraded  i am using my phone from last 1 year it never upgraded to 103 after spending 30000 on this with out software upgrades or bb customer service it is useless blackberry management still feels customers are passionate to spenddonate money for them for no service to customer  either iphone 4s or nexus 5 will work 200 better with all the latest softwares upgrade and pricing about 20000 for blackberry you need to buy all the apps there is no free app on blackberry even if you download any free app the next week onwards you will be getting hundreds of messages purchase that app and it will not perform as the trial period is overthat is the sad story of blackberry please dont get into the same trouble where i am in now
7513	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	first of all one should keep in mind this phone is not a phone for everyone especially those who are the worshiper of samsungmicromax and such other large screen phones and also not for people who are crazy about apps though the app issue has been to great extent through amazon app store but those who love and are fond of the qwerty keys for them this is a real good  true smartphone it is butter smooth awesome sound quality clear and crips call quality good signal reception 4g enabled solid build  feels great in hands and important of all the bb 10 os people who are not aware of the new bb 10 os will definitely have a biased view but ask those who are using the bb 10 os it is simply way ahead and superb for daily as well as corporate usage the hub is a class apart from anything that is out there in the market now it is just that awesome one needs to use it to believe it and to appreciate it if you buy it you will never regret it unless an exceptional case where you be get a faulty phone and that happens with any brand that is there under the sky if you are still confused whether to buy it or not i think you can very well take a risk but i believe you will really appreciate your own decision of buying it after you use it for few days  note to all bb q10 owners if you really want to see the real beauty of you loving device then buy the  casemate cm027420 woods case for blackberry q10 zebrawood or rosewoodbelieve me you will love you device all the more the case makes the q10 look all the more sexy and more premium  cheers
7514	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	ever since bb q10 started doing rounds on the internet i was very much in love with the designlooks and wanted to have it speculations were ripe that it would be launched with a price tag 60 30k got me excited more so but when i checked the price of uk launch it was too costly so i kept hanging on to my curve which i was frustrated with considering that was the first smartphone for me and it really left bad taste in my mouth but i did not lose hope on bb let me say it clearly i am not a fan of big screen phone nor do i care for too many apps i am sure most of the million apps in ios or android are of very little use but that is still a selling point for them i am happy with whatever bb has to offer and now that bb collaborated with amazons appstore bb users would get most of the apps they were craving for which might not work as expected but none the less they are there  on the hardware side 8mp camera is good enough but not comparable to samsungs 13mp or htc m8 4up typing is very good with the keyboard and enough space bw the keys i found typing more comfortable with hw keyboard than on a touch screen phone dual core from qcom snapdragon is really fast jfyi iphone 5s also has a dual core but ios exploits its really good to make the user feel its anything but a dual core  for the amazon this is not the first time i shopped and definitely not the last time i am very happy with the product i received in package
7515	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	great phone in use for 22 days now absolutely no issues suits my primary need for emailing and then some had a version 5xx bb 8900 earlier miss the 34back34 button pain to go to previous page on clicking through links on web pages  and the bb button could have been retained to jump to the home icons screen may be i still need to get used to it
7516	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	guys i am a bb fan and this product is what exactly i wanted i was scared of reviews on amazon itself but i coudnt think of any other mobile but this phone is working absolutely awesome no errors no faults chargins stays for 1 day or more  negative vs postive rewievs  i the phone gets turn off after 40  or less at night its wrong mine stays awake even after 10  phone gets restart automatically 34wrong34 nothing happend with me its been a month apps are difficult to run 34wrong34 as long as u have money all is good  enough of bad rewievs about this phone if you are a blackberry lover dont stop yourself go click buy thanks amazon for this sexy phone this is what i was looking about my bb q10  love the phone i have named my phone too appocalypse 
7517	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	first of all i am a big fan of blackberry but this review is not biased on the fact  i had bought this product from amazon nearly a year ago before that i had been constantly changing phones due to lack of satisfaction but this berry is top notch rarely does it hang battery lasts just over a day and the keyboard is brilliant except for the double tap issuedust probably specs wise youll feel like you are paying a premium but the bbos doesnt require any and also the 1031 update is just brilliant  conslack of apps i couldnt find a proper offline maps that would work in kerala
7518	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	i have always been a diehard blackberry user for business purposes and the way blackberry has managed to integrate the keyboard with touch screen is nothing short of amazing vive la blackberry
7519	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	amazing smart phone guys if you can comparing this product with iphone  anroid or windows phonetrust me this is way above the standard have solid build quality with amazing operating system blackberry 102 if you are looking at high end gaming photo apps this phone is not for you this is purely business phone which takes cares for your day to day emails business messages you must experience blackberry hub where can receive all messages at one place  thankful to amazon for delivering this product at much cheaper than flipkart and in record time
7520	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	dont buy it i bought the phone on the independence dayaug 15 from a local retailer this was after a great experience with the bb bold 9780 which was used for a little over 3 years what awaited me was the most horrendous experience after buying a product the phone started heating up and losing battery within 8 hours after 6 days the phone was taken to the service center in cunningham roadbangalore and i was advised that the heating is being caused by the cut sim that was used i took the phone back and replaced the sim the heating and battery problems persisted along with a new problem of weak signals when the same was taken back to the service center in exactly 17 days i was asked to submit the phone and was given a time frame of 15 business days to rectify the issue when i asked for an immediate replacement i was told that the phone should have been given back within 15 days after contacting the regional manager i was told that his companyblackberry was not in a good shape because of which they have been asked to not replace phones with problems even when they are brand new i have been asked to wait for 30 business days for a replacement as it is apparently not in stock my advice dont buy it no one likes to be treated like thrash after spending on a sinking phone brand
7521	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	pros  great keyboard  touch screen good camera good quality speakers great battery life good build qualityfeels really nice to hold  cons  music player has no equalizer would help people get better sound effects by tuning rather than buying expensive headphones as the current sound is just plain flat could use more free appsall the good stuff has to be paid for  over all i like this phone a lot and if these 2 small issues can be fixed it would be just perfect
7522	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	select network to 2g only or 3g only or 3g 4g only sorry i forgot the network options  but do not select 2g 3g both this is the main reason for less battery backup
7523	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	first of all its a psychological fact anyone can use an android smartphone  and thats where its falling down every software should have a status a standard android has failed to create a specific market of users by letting everyone to use it by making it very cheap nowadays you can use android even for rs 1000 but youll go mad by its worst quality if you use one  now coming to blackberry it has never lost its status it may commercially fail in this hopeless world but let me repeat blackberry will never lose its status it has its own potential specific users  the reasons why im saying this are as follows  1 blackberry is born for effective communication  never ever think of this phone if youre buying a phone primarily for games watching videos or other entertainment reasons a mobile phone can provide all these things but its primary functionality is to communicate and blackberry is the only os which provides this much seamless and quality communication  of any mode  a phone calls  voice quality is crystal clear i wonder how blackberry picks up signal even in weak coverage areas  b messages and emails  this is where blackberry stands out of the crowd and this is the reason you should own a blackberry q10 the way they have organized your mail accounts and messages is like man i dont have any words to say blackberry algorithm is amazing when comes to the fully organized blackberry hub life becomes very organized and easier  c social accounts  facebook twitter and other social sites are time wasters if you log in to their main webpage but when configured these accounts in blackberry hub it only disturbs you when there is something really important from these sites useless video uploads invites for playing games are time wasters and you can switch them off and spend your time in only important things through customized notifications  2 keyboard typing  all of us know that blackberry is the only smartphone which provides a physical keyboard and i want to add that  blackberry alone can do that androids and iphones can never bring one and typing experience in blackberry is breeeeeeeeze you wont stop typing if you start no noise of buttons very fast and accurate typing which gives you a tangible feedback youll forget those swiping touchscreen keyboards of androids and windows 100s of shortcuts also  3 os and user interface  i loved the blackberry os since it has released its version 7 os but i was unable to buy one at that time blackberry 102 os is really great with its new features this ui has lot of gestures and its full of swipy the blackberry peek option is wonderful overall the ui is very intuitive  only highstatus people will prefer blackberry smartphones thats what everyone think let it be but if this phone comes under your budget you should use this smartphone seemless communication intuitive os and ui amazing keyboard typing experience  yes there are still some scope of improvements but according to me this is the best
7524	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	its the greatest blackberry device superfast and supersmooth touch is very responsive screen quality is better than iphone its a must have device
7525	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	have used almost all bb versions and this is one of the best smooth  pretty  light and high end using iphone 6plus as second phone bb is a class apart not for the teenage looking for fun its a high work usage phone and excels above any other phone for emails  messages and other work related usage i prefer one pf my two phones to be always a bb and if unwant efficient typing and connectivity this is the best option
7526	BlackBerry Q10 (Black)	ive fallen in love with this phone ive nexus 5  ive used ios devices but none are even close to this beast mind it its not a gaming device rather its a communication device packed with impressive business features mail calendar bb remember bb hubmuch better than notification center of ios and android bbm video etc im waiting for bb 103 to arrive on it which will make it even more powerful

7587	HTC Desire Eye M910X	this is my quick review  the desire eye can take better pictures and it is water resistant the battery life is almost as good as on the m8 go for the desire eye perfect sense fantastic camera no overheat no frozen screen  camera  probably the best front camera and decent back camera as compared to others performance  benchmarks may not be the bestbut is smooth even under heavy usageworks great in daily usage battery life  amazing last full day screenone of the best displays availableeven better than m8 touch and feel the sense ui is the answer  cons gestures are not always handy hard to open for sim replacement no beats audio plastics body not so premium as the m8
7588	HTC Desire Eye M910X	short analysis   design  910 display  910 software 810 performance  810 battery life  610 camera  710 value for money  710  in depth review   design  in appearance the desire eye is no one m8 it8217s not made from metal and sits in the middle of htc8217s smartphone portfolio however its twotone plastic finish is far from ugly and it8217s solid and easy to grip i found the finish to be less tacky than the galaxy s5 and note 4 the most peculiar thing about the desire eye8217s appearance is its large frontfacing camera  surprisingly though it isn8217t distracting and works well what8217s also nice is the fact that the phone8217s speakers have been placed cleanly at either end of its display at first glance it would seem there aren8217t any at all but there are if you look carefully  display  the desire eye comes packed with a 52inch 1080 x 1920 pixels display with a density of 424 pixels per inch ppi this is virtually the same as htc8217s flagship one m8 though that manages a slightly higher pixel density of 441 ppi  colors are sharp and wideranged with darks in particular standing out like the majority of smartphones though colors aren8217t as clear when exposed to daylight however this isn8217t a major issue and you can still enjoy your favorite shows and movies while on the go  software  the desire eye runs android kitkat with htc8217s sense 6 ui atop sense has to be one of the simplest android uis out there unlike samsung8217s touchwiz which is cluttered with superfluous animations and functions here there8217s a sense of fluency that makes it easy to use and good to look at  what8217s particularly useful is the blinkfeed function situated on the phone8217s homescreen it provides you with a list of content you8217re interested in 8211 from newspaper reports to social media updates  another nifty feature is htc8217s do not disturb mode which lets you disable notifications at certain times of the day if you8217re an ios user you may have noticed that this is the same name as apple8217s variant they8217re both good and get the job done  there8217s full access to the google play store too as you8217d expect  performance  sporting a quadcore snapdragon 801 processor the desire eye is wellequipped it8217s not up to the standard of the snapdragon 805 but it8217s still powerful enough to provide you with a smooth performance and can handle demanding games like asphalt 8 there8217s also 2gb of ram and 16gb of internal storage on offer which can be expanded with an additional up to 128gb via the microsd card slot  the desire eye offers up a 2400mah battery which is smaller than the m88217s by just 200mah according to htc it has 20 hours of talk time and can last up to 538 hours on standby  camera  the desire eye has two 13megapixel cameras 8211 one on the front and one on the back there8217s also a dualled flash on the front which means you get to take selfies in the day as well as at night the only thing different with the frontfacer is that it has a smaller aperture thanks to a dedicated shutter button you won8217t have a problem taking photos and there8217s a fast shutter speed you won8217t be disappointed with the overall quality either as photos look sharp and colorful what is worth noting however is that images taken in the dark lack detail slightly and the dualled can make photos look washed out this isn8217t a problem you get with the iphone8217s dualled rear flash but there isn8217t a flash on the front  verdict  this is one of the most selfieobsessed smartphones out there so if you8217re vain you needn8217t look any further  if you8217re not into your selfies you may find it inconvenient to have a huge frontfacing camera slapped in front of you that said the desire eye is certainly capable as an allrounder with an elegant and strong design a fast processor and a battery that can get you through the day

7604	Gionee Elife Mini E7 (White)	after being a nokia loyalist ever since i started using a mobile phone i decided to give another brand a chance and picked up this mobile for its impressive specifications  from the day 1 the dual sim slot of the phone did not work but i could not give it for repair immediately as i was told to leave the phone with customer care for a week however finally when i got around to give it still under warranty time i was told that it will be repaired on a chargeable basis as the slot was damaged by the user  the mobile charger of gionee goes bad within a few months prior to this i had never heard of mobile chargers going bad and when reported to their service center they were not ready to take the responsibility after back and forth phone calls to their headoffice it was clear that their customer care is extremely chaotic and really bad i gave up on them and stopped following up bought a diff brand charger instead  with my nokia phones i never had to visit a customer center and here in less than a year of buying the phone i have wasted quite a few days of my time overall very dissatisfied and wont recommend to anyone going for this brand
7605	Gionee Elife Mini E7 (White)	i have used this phone for over a year and there is no problem that i have not faced with this phone it has a very poor screen with even poorer touch interphase and the lag in pushing the button and phone reacting is painfully obvious the battery life of the phone is terrible and it takes forever to charge the phone also does not charge properly till switched after the applications that come with phone are very irritating the earphone of the mobile and voice clarity is very poor the speed with which the phone works seems that it has only one core let alone the octa core claim that the phone manufactures make  this phone has made me resolve never to buy a chinese manufactured mobile again and never even consider a gionee phone again the only reason i am still using it is that it was so expensive that i am waiting for the phone to be utterly unusable before i buy a new one  anshu mahajan
7606	Gionee Elife Mini E7 (White)	i bought many products from amazonthis product was delevered after 5 days of committed date  the product is very good came with scratch guard stero headset and flip cover i am taking out one point due to late delevery

7637	Micromax Canvas Doodle 2 A240 (Blue)	scratch guard already with several used marks on it  when i tried to pair blue tooth head phone it already displayed hp  nokia some blue tooth on the list  which means someone got this phone and returned back i received the same used ones i was totally disappointed with this producti never expected this from amazonin
7638	Micromax Canvas Doodle 2 A240 (Blue)	micromax canvas doodle 2 a240 is a midrange phone priced around 15k as of this writing this is a huge device 57 inch screen with a 720p ips display  62 highlights  mediatek 6589 processor clocked at 12 ghz  for the pricethey should have accommodated a 15 ghz mtk6589t processor  good 720p display  2600mah nonremovable battery  1 gb ram  16 gb internal storage  no sdcard slot  otg support is there  gaming performance is same as you see on any other mtk6589 device popular games like temple runsubway surfersripetide gp2 etc ran without any issues some high end games failed to run though  camera performance of the 12mp rear cam is average it takes washed out pictures outdoorsand grainy noisy low light images  verdict  overall a good midrange huge phablet at this price range now you can get far better devices though mtk6582 quadcore devices now available are more powerful and cheaper than the devices came out earlier with mtk6589 quadcore
7639	Micromax Canvas Doodle 2 A240 (Blue)	this is an awesome product really great features in my opinion its better than samsung note 2 comparing  these 2 items l hardly find 1 or 2 extra feature in note 2 but this product is less than half price of note 2 this is a really really really good product by micromax at this price
7640	Micromax Canvas Doodle 2 A240 (Blue)	i am satisfied this phone  its amazingnow i have no required any other product it is fully satisfying me
7641	Micromax Canvas Doodle 2 A240 (Blue)	price of this product was 13400 even the price of this product at my local market was 14500 processor is quardcore which is fine for gaming and other application process ram is 2gb and internal memory is 16gb
7642	Micromax Canvas Doodle 2 A240 (Blue)	it was only after buying the phone that i realized that this model from micromax has some issues for me the problem started appearing after a couple of months the phone wont boot up some reviews on the net asked me to press the up and down arrow key for 23 minutes to make the phone boot up but after 23 tries that option went away as well as you cant take out the battery there is no other way of starting this phone up  as of now i have sent this phone to the micromax support who have taken almost a month now and havent returned it back some part is taking a long time they say  micromax has a reputation for bad customer support and i am one of the aggrieved customers avoid micromax phones in a bid to grow they come up with new models and are also int he race for android one models but they dont know how to service their existing customers  for me this turned out to be a bad buy
7643	Micromax Canvas Doodle 2 A240 (Blue)	the phone is bulky otherwise everything all right good service from amazonin but when i opened the bluetooth i found there is already paired a micromax a55 so what is reason behind that  is it used one   the phone specification is satisfied the features are very useful and the battery is also quit ok
7644	Micromax Canvas Doodle 2 A240 (Blue)	i would have given it 5 star if screen size and weight would have been reduced its pain to carry such huge mobile which doesnt fit your pocket and videos doesnt play well and you gotta use your both the hands always to operate your phone  operating features rocks  physical features sucks
7645	Micromax Canvas Doodle 2 A240 (Blue)	a nice phone but loudspeaker and camera are averagesound from loudspeaker is low camera performed well in good light but poor in low light

7703	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	huawei ascend y511 is a budget device priced around 7k  pros good dual core processor  scores around 11000 in antutu  close to stock android experience 45 inch screen ips display android 422 jellybean  cons 512 mb ram only poor camera 1730mah battery can only last a day of average use  if you are buying a phone just for using a few apps like facebookwhatsapp etcthis specs are more than enoughthis could have been a good budget device if it had 1gb of ram unfortunately only 512 mb is on boardwhich means you might experience occasional lags here and there while playing games and switching between apps
7704	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	my requirements in a smartphone were fast internet browsing dual sim and good battery backup this phone comes with very good features for my use fully charged battery lasts for one entire day 24 hours internet on 2g is a lot better than its counterparts samsung htc micromax  camera quality is not so good but it wasnt my priority  overall very good phone
7705	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	phone in working very good work absolute fine   front camera works good 03 back camera very bad3mp battery performance not very good design very cool display ok  over all product is good at rs6650 my advice buy huawie product
7706	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	overall phone is gud but the major problem is that it will work slow with memory card of 8gb is used and card is full till 7gb another major part is this mobile reboot by itself while calling this irritates a lot the user
7707	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	works very nice battery is absolutely super touch response is unbelievable it has very smooth soft touch only thing lack is service i am from hyderabad the serivce centre is too worst but the phone hav good qualities
7708	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	i found this phone having the best configuration at this price 6840 inr but theres catch  how one could get all this at this price on this date ive got my answer either the product has nothing do about or the manufacturer has nothing to care about  reliability and professionalism in products  in simple words you get the product and most of the technical features in it but suddenly if your phone slips of sweaty hands at say crowded streets or train station you probably have to pick 3 pieces of your phone battery back cover and and the main phone part no it would hardly break but dissembles no matter how tight you fix back cover you dont expect this kind of things either they use to break or they wont break  inside youll find 2 for sims and 1 microsd card slot the setup is so cramped and weird that there is fair chance that you may need to open back cover and reposition the sim card sometimes because the sim cards might slip a bit due to shocks and wont work but the microsd card slot was the worst i have never found any device that doesnot 34clicklock34 to avoid slip and dropping off of this very important sd card memory but this device was having the same slip sim card style slot who was the jerk who designed it and who approved it too  when you turn on the phone the internal software and os was working good and fast and 512 mb was not found to be any issue battery lasted a day no heating on charging  however the picture and videos can be viewed clear and good only if the picture or video is of good resolution and good picture quality otherwise may look worse  the lowest brightness of phone is too high cant work on the phone at low or no lights the brightness hits on eyes not good to work on this phone in dark  i didnot yet mentioned the manufacturing defect in this phone the microsd memory card slot was not working i had to return this product due to that thank god  earlier few months ago i have had bought unlocked internet data card e303 of huawei and in that i couldnt recognize that the 3g wifi hotspot feature was not working after a month i found it but it wasnot that important to me so i disregarded it and still bought this phone well that was a bad idea  i donot recommend this product i donot recommend huawei products unless you have worked or used one already better buy the same model if you still buy test it thoroughly within 5 days and return immediately if found any defect  or choose other options especially those companies whose headquarters not located in shenzhen china since as per my personal analysis companies from that area 34usually34 are 34amateurishly managed34 and so do their 34products are unreliable34 including software products too  good luck with phone shopping
7709	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	for the price it is a fantastic phone and meets all my needs for affordable communication through 2g 3g and internet only negative issue is the camera  which is not good  but i do not use my phone camera for taking digital pictures and i am using it as an ebook reader as well  installed coolreader for android no issue with the battery which gives ample time of almost 36 hrs in between charging and it is using mini sim which is the size generally available with all dealers in india so no need to cut the sim to convert to a microsim so my sims remain fully compatible with my normal mobile phones for use in emergency
7710	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	seriously first time i made mistake in selecting mobile phones very bad ui and user experience  think before you buy
7711	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	within a month of purchase there was a problem in display its a manufacturing defect worst quality from huaweibetter go for  known brands

7713	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	android interface is cheeky screen is good doesnt work good while charging camera plays the damp to this phone good at this price point but dont expect too much
7714	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	its a good smart phone but not a very good phone but u can manage with thatoverall performance and looks of the phone is too good at this price o its pure value for money
7715	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	excellent mobile
7716	Huawei Ascend Y511 (Black)	this is really a very excellent product from huawei it looks like very expensive mobile like samsunghtc  price is very reasonable at amazon  huawei is the one of the best mobile manufacturing co in the world not rebranded like micromaxkarbonnintexlavaiball  processor is very fast  all the apps runs very smooth  music sound is very good  display is crystal clear  ram is 512k but there is no problem at all for running any apps  camera is the only average quality otherwise almost very good mobile its very good idea to buy huawei instead of any expensive mobile like samsunghtclgsony  thank you

7752	Karbonn Sparkle V Android One | Magnum Blue	karbonn sparkle v is an android one device released along with other androidone devices from spice and micromax since this is build on googles reference design all these devices have the same internal specs only the outward looks change  whats in the box  phonebatteryscreen guardchargerheadphones not inear   display  ips display with good viewing angles and is pleasing to look at even though the ppi is low no complains  looks and build quality  the back panel is not matte finished rather it has a smooth panel and is not that grippy the front of the device is almost identical to other first gen android one devices build quality is ok for the price the phone is quite heavy which is surprising as it only has a small 1700mah battery inside  software and performance  this comes with android 444 out of the box and is expected to get android l update by the end of january google is promising 2 years of software support which is great for the price overall performance of the device is good hardly saw any lags while multitasking mediatek mt6582 quadcore performs quite well and you can play many popular games without any issues  camera  both cameras are just average nothing to get excited about  battery this only has a 1700mah battery which wont last a full day of use if you use internet often this is in my opinion the biggest issue with these androidone devices to get better backup from this small battery use art runtime  google search to know how to switch to art from dalvik  hopefully we can expect further battery improvements in the upcoming android l ota for this device  storage  4gb internal around 25gb available you cannot choose default app install location as the sdcard but you can move supported apps to sdcard otg is not supported  verdict  i bought this solely for the 2 year software support from google if you dont care about updates you can get better devices under 10k range in india now if you have access to a charging port alwayslike a laptop or a pc the small battery is not that big a concernnext gen androidone devices are coming first quarter of 2015with better specs and hopefully a bigger batteryi would recommend waiting for those if smaller battery and a low resolution display is an issue for you

7796	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	first of allthe htc one look alike image uploaded on this by amazon as a product image is fake i have uploaded the real m2 images in product images section   main highlights 1 4200mah battery  can easily last 2 days of very heavy usage 2 quadcore  mtk6582m processor 3 1 gb ram 4 android 42 jellybean  4200mah battery is unheard in a device shipping at this price range the other 2 handsets that ships with similar battery are lenovo p780 and xolo q3000but both are priced much higher than this due to the huge battery it needs to accommodatethe device is bulky and a little heavier than other smartphones the display is a 5 inch one with a resolution of 480 x 854 pixelswhich is not that greatbut ok the viewing angles are also not that great the processorgpu combination is powerful enough to play many of the games without much issues and the jellybean on board runs smooth gionee has opted to ship this with a custom ui instead of android stock ui   some misc info this is a dual sim phone  one is the normal sim slot while the other is a micro sim slot otg is not supported sensors on board  accelerometermagnetic sensorlight sensorproximity sensororientation sensors capacitive buttons are not backlighted always   camera impressive for the price 8mp rear camera takes good pictures when it comes to video departmentthis can shoot 1080p videos at 30fps  benchmark scores quadrant  5800 antutu  17200 nenamark 2  55fps   verdict  overall a great handset with a huge battery that can easily last 2 days of heavy usevalue for money  4 stars only because of a low resolution display and an older android version
7797	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	very nicec phone with all necessary features guys trust me its a worth phone in the range of 10000if anybody want to spend 10k to 12 k then go for itthis phone vill never let you down except itz brand name otherwise itz like apple phonei have one word for this phoneexcellent
7798	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	features match similarly priced models of different brands battery performance is fantastic camera is ok overall performance of handset is satisfactory
7799	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	bought this one for 1 android experience 2 battery backup it has so far met my expectations lots of positive sides of the set i wont mention all 1 battery backup its the wow factor i got 3 days with usual usage 2 is getting ota kitkat update anytime now a few cons 1 front facing camera seems to be poorly fitted many m2 users have faced this problem 2 gionee india service center poorly distributed over india 3 no official stock rom available as of yet few unofficial stock roms and many custom roms are available
7800	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	excellent phone a really feature rich phone huge battery excellent display which is visible in sunlight bought it for my wife and really glad to see her happy its antutu benchmark score was a good 17504 much better than my micromax 116i  an excellent camera app lots of useful widgets but also good amount  of unwanted softwares come with it  had to disable the crappy antivirus software which came with it  the best part of the phone is that though it has only 4gb space it is smartly partitioned and leaves about 17gb free after installing loads of softwares including those which cannot be moved to external card the only con i would say that it takes hell lot of time to charge it4200mh battery ofcourse it stays with u for 2 days though i definitely recommend it and hope the service if needed is of topclass as well
7801	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	i had purchased m2 white about 6 months back earlier i was using only one sim few weeks back i just tried to insert the other micro sim but the micro sim slot was not detecting the sim i send the mail to the company regarding the same and i was advised to visit the service centre at janak puri  but they refused saying they are no more with the gionee after that i was advised to visit the service centre at ramesh nagar but they were charging 450 for the same simply saying sim tray is damaged and company does not cover these things under warrantyafter sending mails to the company on regular basis finally i was told to visit the service centre at uttam nagar but to my surprise they were charging 850 for the same  buying gionee product is just like lottery either you win or you loose every thing your money faith time and the company persons will watch like spectators 
7802	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	okay i recieved this on 8th june2014 this is a great phone its working really good you get two scratch guards with the phone gionee just released 34kitkat 44234 update for this model and i am using it which is even better overall really good phone with a monstrous battery
7803	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	battery life is extremely good  the sound and display are sharp as well the plus is 3g works even when the primary sim slot is empty the only downside is the ringer should have been louder and the absence of a lit up indicator
7804	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	i got this mobile with lots of apprehension but after using it am extremely happy pros the sumo battery which goes on and on even with heavy usage dual sim and data use lasts more than 3 days large clear screen good camera for the price ease of usage nice touch 1gb ram giving good speed  cons heavy beacuse of battery i guess screen guard must as its not gorrila glass  overall if anyone wants to buy this dont think twice just hit the button and you will never regretlove u gionee
7805	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	i have bought this smart phone after much research i am fully satisfied with the facilities offered in this phone great battery for less money touch sense and all other functions are very good only one thing that should be improved in this phone is back cemera though it is 8 mp picture quality is not soo good
7806	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	excellent phone from gionee we can play any high graphic games in this phone with out any lag and battery back up and camery is nice but the only defect i had observed is the volume of the ringtone is low and music player sound is low
7807	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	for the price it does the job well all features and sensors work pictures are decent from the camera it comes with scratch guard and a pouch i had clubbed a separate scratch guard  cover which was not needed
7808	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	value for money q u i c k  d e l i v e r y    
7809	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	the 4200 mah battery is the highlight of this phone and it lasted more than two days with gps location and wifi on and in use the entire time
7810	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	the best battery life speed is good screen response time is superb camera is faster than any other mobile cam  the weight is more but when youre satisfied with battery backup you dont care about it
7811	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	awesomevery handy long battery life smartphonewith excelant front and  back camerahd video quality is superhandy to use with fast internet
7812	Gionee M2 (Black, 4GB)	mast phone h  all features are good and working properly i am lovin itits amazing phone no need to worry about

7830	Xolo Q600 (White)	first of all the xolo brand was awesome this phone im using 9 months till now not a single prob is their and the sound qualiy is awesome and the camera is also good which comes 5mp and also hd recordings and a very imp thing the battery backup was really awsome so i want to say go for it
7831	Xolo Q600 (White)	as promised by amazons oneday delivery option the phone was delivered in time but to my disappointment the phone has manufacturing defect and issues first it had battery drain problem but when i charged the battery overnight it was okay and no more battery problems the next thing and that is still an issue is the camera the phone has 5mp  super bright led flash autofocus camera which initially worked fine but after an hour of usage it does not focus on any object which are far than 3 inch every thing is all the way blurred sgx544 is a good gpu top 10 as of 2014 ratings since amazon has no replacement policy so i am kind of forced to go for refund i hope to get full refund for the same
7832	Xolo Q600 (White)	its excellent i like the way which amazon delivers  every thing is good phone is amazing and dont expose to heat yaar ur phone may damage  and put good members for delivery rather than every thing is fine 
7833	Xolo Q600 (White)	the rear camera had black spot it was a mfg fault it seems there is no quality check at any point of time by the amazon team  or its retailers who sell the product by simple checking beforehand you can avoid of exchanging the items enhance customer satisfaction no hassles of returning the goods and this in turn will reduce your overheads and increase the profitability or will allow you to sell the products at more competitive prices keeping your margins intact
7834	Xolo Q600 (White)	the xolo q600 does amazing stuff for the price until now no issues the only other purchase i love is the xiomi redmi 1s after release of this phone in the market but from an indian company q600 comes as an amazing vfm the main reason i went for this is the battery life which is one of the best in this class of phones with quadcore no issues so far
7835	Xolo Q600 (White)	there are many cheap smartphones in the market after some research i found xolo600 to have the best hardware for the least cost using the phone for 2 months now and it works pretty well overall a good purchase for the price as far as the packaging and delivery are concerned amazon is as good as it gets
7836	Xolo Q600 (White)	1 sound quality is very poorbiggest flaw and show stopper 62cant hear songs or video in crowd or even using the earphones 2 ram is also quite less 3 internal memory also not much so inspite of the quad core thing these are the bottlenecks
7837	Xolo Q600 (White)	phone is niceworking very good but videos playing poor quality value for moneyi feel happy with this phonebetter than branded phones
7838	Xolo Q600 (White)	did nt expect it wil be that good but im highly satisfied and suggested many to buy this phone tk cr
7839	Xolo Q600 (White)	xolo q600 and 500 both are excellent and value for money micromax screen gaurd is worthless and most of them a
7840	Xolo Q600 (White)	its picture quality is fab  it has amazing features fast performance of ram  user friendly but if it has 111gb ram it will be great
7841	Xolo Q600 (White)	best backup  best displaytouch response best 2g  3g network speed 1 day backup for full day data using if an hour data use per day with several calls then battery lasts for 3 days so this is best mobile i am reviewing this after a month usage
7842	Xolo Q600 (White)	hai awesome i used one month no problemit comfort to my pocketbattery backup for me one day long usage camera clarity is very good i like this product very muchnothing to say
7843	Xolo Q600 (White)	really very good phone in such price range internet speed is very fast volume of sound speaker looks slow as compare to other smart phones
7844	Xolo Q600 (White)	it is an awesome quadcore phone with many things i used it and strongly recommends that any else also useit
7845	Xolo Q600 (White)	awesome mobile very good performance it would have been awesome if the ram is 1gp camera also performing good made in india really worth for valuable money
7846	Xolo Q600 (White)	good phone in range between 5k to 10k  point of concern is only customer care service by xolo when any problem occurs
7847	Xolo Q600 (White)	good mobile no hangbut has lag while using uc browsercamera clarity is goodbattery drains very fast while using mobile data
7848	Xolo Q600 (White)	given piece is defective and service not provided properly because of that i dont like it self recommend while purchasing be carefull
7849	Xolo Q600 (White)	overall build quality is very good there are few things it can improve on  the screen cover were having air bubbles the second cover provided was not of good quality  the phone is a bit bulky
7850	Huawei Ascend G6 (Black)	so simple to use its like an iphone

7930	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	a duplicate apple i phone 5 without a warranty  mismatched serial no was supplied which we came to know only after taking this to a i phone store in chennai the subsequent handling of the complaint from amazonin was highly disappointing because they are trying to pass the problem to their supplier  vendor with whom we the customer have nothing to do the on line order was placed on the trust we have with amazonin  we are still pursuing the complaint with the hope amazonin would do proper investigation and provide justice  hope better sense would prevail with amazonin to ensure the trust is not lost in the initial stages of their operations in india
7931	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	ordered iphone 5 from amazon around 2 weeks back and here goes the review  i already own a galaxy s4 and my review about the product is mainly the comparison between the two i am not biased toward any one of these both have their own pros and cons i will take it up one by one on most desired characteristics of a phone for an average user  1 media codec support this is one of the most desired features for me i use my phone mostly for checking mails and media as per my experience galaxy s4 is better than iphone 5 you can play almost anything on s4 but on iphone 5 you need to have good paid apps to get the job done this round goes to s4  2 transferring content transferring content on iphone 5 is not easy you need to have either wifi or itunes to get your job done this is not the case with galaxy s4 you can transfer content the way you wantfast usb transfer since i use linux for my day to day activities i prefer to use galaxy s4 as my media consumption device since itunes doesnt exist for linux i have to rely on wifi to transfer my content to iphone which is cumbersome this round goes to galaxy s4  3 battery when it comes to battery life iphone 5 is a monster i get more than a day on a full recharge with galaxy s4 i had to do a lot of tricks to get better battery life more you install the apps on your android lesser will be the battery life this is not the case with any ios device this round goes to iphone 5  4 internal memory with iphone 5 i got around 13 gb and with galaxy s4 i got around 9 gb free internal storage i have filled my iphone upto 125 gb and i didnot feel even 5 degradation in performance device still runs smooth and there is no change in battery life my galaxy s4 has about 5 gb filled with apps games and music and i see a huge degradation in performance i am wondering if i would install more apps and games the performance would go down further by 3040 also after installing a 64gb class 10 ext sd card s4 has become further slow and i see stutters and lag while navigating across ui this round goes to iphone 5  5 user experiencespeedresponse time i would say iphone 5 is a definite winner in this case all apps and games run very fast and response for any action is very quick android is open source and extremely customizable but all of this comes at a price of performance galaxy s4 is fast but not as fast as iphone 5 galaxy s4 contains a lots of features but most of them are useless also lock screen of galaxy s4 is extremely slow sometimes it take 34 sec to turn s4 lock screen on after pressing the power button this annoys me a lot this round goes to iphone 5  6 gaming games run smoother on iphone than my galaxy s4 difference is clearly noticeable when you play heavy games obviously it is not noticeable when playing small games iphone 5 wins this one  7 customization no doubt android wins this round ios has almost no customization but i really dont care much about this widgets are almost useless to me as they get refreshed after 12 sec of moving to the window they belong to rooting a device is another benefit with android as there are lot many custom roms available but i really dont have much time to do all these this one goes to galaxy s4  8 media streamingfrom video streaming websites you will not be able to play content from lot many websites on an ios device and streaming will be slower compared to android on many other websites this round goes to galaxy s4 definitely there is a very fast youtube app for ios device but i stream videos from many other websites for which there is no app this makes my s4 as the primary media streaming device  9 ecosystemapps ios has the more polished faster and better quality apps apps have beautiful interface and they are faster too because they run natively and not on top of any dalvik vm as in android because things have to run on top of a dalvik vm in android it can never become faster than ios this one goes to iphone 5  10 looks and usability no doubt iphone 5 looks way better than galaxy s4 also when it comes to ui ios ui is way better looking than android in terms of usability i prefer iphone 5 because it has just the perfect size i prefer to use my phone with 1 hand iphone 5 is just perfect when you want to use a phone on the go iphone 5 is the perfect size for daily use and fits nicely in pocket but smaller screen is not very good for media consumption this round goes to iphone 5  11 hardware definitely ios devices have more powerful hardware also material used is much better in iphone 5 this round goes to iphone 5  please note that i dont favour any of these platforms specifically and i am not biased to any specific platform i use my galaxy s4 for media consumption and iphone for gaming browsing reading news and chat as you can see all have their advantages and disadvantages but i prefer iphone 5 over my galaxy s4 for day to day activities
7932	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	first off i do believe this is overpriced and i would probably not have bought this at a 45k price tag however i ended up getting one without paying for oneprovided by my employer like all apple products very high quality build and a fantastic ios operating system that does not crash mid way this could be missing some fancy features that competition is boasting of but that is easily compensated by the assured reliability this offers i have owned the previous generation of iphones and i have a ipad along with a first gen galaxy note i can tell you from my experience that if price is not a constraint there is no better phone to buy
7933	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	iphone5 is good but not good for battery lifethis is my first apple iphone i like it but not my expectations fulfil apple is not good for those who have not computers and not good in 2g network
7934	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	ive been an apple fan and user since the last 9 years i own an imac mbp ipad ipod and the iphone 3gs recently i upgraded my phone to the iphone 5 its an awesome smartphone but the cellphone signal reception is truly something that has started bothering me a lot while other vodafone users with android and winmo get full signal my calls keep dropping frequently waiting for the ios 7 and hoping that it has some signal boosting feature as well  nirmal biswas 
7935	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	the best phones i ever used its awesome very efficient very easy to use and handle touch is simply superb including the processing speed
7936	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	i was initially excited to take delivery of this iphone 5 but soon discovered that it was the us version this is not an issue in itself if you only plan to use 3g and 2g but it will not be compatible with 4g which is clearly going to be an issue as the 4g coverage in the india begins to expand over the next couple of years  loving this phone compared to my old iphone 4 its noticeably slimmer and much lighter and does look great oh and as for dimensions it shouldnt bother you it certainly hasnt bothered me making the change from the iphone 4 to the iphone 5 its a bit longer but my fingers reach i was hoping that the finish would be hard wearing enough that i didnt need to buy a case for it though as i love the look of the matte white back however it does like the other review mention start to chip and scratch very easily
7937	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	it is a master piece of technology price is high but you know that you are paying for innovation and hard work gone to make this wonderful piece it hurts when you see the same is being copied by making use of legal loopholes and sold cheaply
7938	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	i think its worth the price tag easy to use and has maximum features beautiful screen with high quality camera os 7 is by far best easy to understand and useneed to improve battery backup but really iphone 5 does need any comment
7939	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	its a really high 5 the easy to understand  and handle  suggest to purchase only i phone in future also like to purchase only apple products
7940	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	very sophisticated sleek smartphone i like its compactness than iphone 6 64gb is hell of a lot of memory to hold all your favourite musics videos podcasts images and more the camera is very smart the phone never hangs unlike androids battery life is very good the ios 812 is most advance to run any application flawlessly i had earlier iphone 4 and i chose 5 against 6 for its sleekness best phone for executives
7941	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	a bit pricey for my liking but brought 2 for my sisters and they love it best wedding present decision i made
7942	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	piece of art you like to keep holding onto this is what an iphone 5 is its not plastickyneither is its software crappy yes its cost u around 5k extra and u pay it for no nonsense
7943	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	i really love apple products and i dont blame amazon for this damage but i have received a product which is unfit from inside and is giving weird sounds of a loose part when shaken this certainly is not expected from apples level of fit and finish and also not expected from amazons store which keeps only fit and perfect products would like it if replaced with a better one for now disappointed
7944	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	iphone5 is very nice phone with ultimate features and functionality and with ios7 it becomes amazing  it has only issue with battery that discharge fast it may be due to lot of applications also

7950	Lava Iris 405 Plus (Black)	iris 405 plus is a budget smartphone from lava priced at rs 5999 as of this writing the looks of the phone is good but like any other budget devicethis too come with a lot of flaws i would strongly recommend you to buy a better quadcore 1gb ram device around rs 10000 than settling for this device  some notable issues 1 13 ghz dual core processor and only 512 mb ram  if you are gonna use this phone for just a few apps like whatsappfacebook etcyou may find this combination sufficient not suitable for high end gamingbut can play some basic games thoughexpect lags often while multitasking 2 camera quality is just below average and its a fixed focus one without auto focusits hard to get good blur free images 3 battery backup can be an issue as it only packs a 1400mah battery 4 back cover lacks grip  slippery  my recommendation is to consider devices like xolo q700icanvas turbo mini canvas 22 a114 etc rather buying this budget device as thoseeven though priced a few thousands moregives good performance
7951	Lava Iris 405 Plus (Black)	if youre looking for a stylish phone with good grip then youre on the right way i was amazed by the thickness and looks of this phone pros good battery backup around 1 day with normal use 90 mm thick awesome design good grip camera is nice  cons 512 mb of ram sometimes lag while multitasking  overall i would like to suggest you to buy it if youre bound to this budget and interested in good looking stylish phone

7965	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	ordered iphone 5 from amazon around 2 weeks back and here goes the review  i already own a galaxy s4 and my review about the product is mainly the comparison between the two i am not biased toward any one of these both have their own pros and cons i will take it up one by one on most desired characteristics of a phone for an average user  1 media codec support this is one of the most desired features for me i use my phone mostly for checking mails and media as per my experience galaxy s4 is better than iphone 5 you can play almost anything on s4 but on iphone 5 you need to have good paid apps to get the job done this round goes to s4  2 transferring content transferring content on iphone 5 is not easy you need to have either wifi or itunes to get your job done this is not the case with galaxy s4 you can transfer content the way you wantfast usb transfer since i use linux for my day to day activities i prefer to use galaxy s4 as my media consumption device since itunes doesnt exist for linux i have to rely on wifi to transfer my content to iphone which is cumbersome this round goes to galaxy s4  3 battery when it comes to battery life iphone 5 is a monster i get more than a day on a full recharge with galaxy s4 i had to do a lot of tricks to get better battery life more you install the apps on your android lesser will be the battery life this is not the case with any ios device this round goes to iphone 5  4 internal memory with iphone 5 i got around 13 gb and with galaxy s4 i got around 9 gb free internal storage i have filled my iphone upto 125 gb and i didnot feel even 5 degradation in performance device still runs smooth and there is no change in battery life my galaxy s4 has about 5 gb filled with apps games and music and i see a huge degradation in performance i am wondering if i would install more apps and games the performance would go down further by 3040 also after installing a 64gb class 10 ext sd card s4 has become further slow and i see stutters and lag while navigating across ui this round goes to iphone 5  5 user experiencespeedresponse time i would say iphone 5 is a definite winner in this case all apps and games run very fast and response for any action is very quick android is open source and extremely customizable but all of this comes at a price of performance galaxy s4 is fast but not as fast as iphone 5 galaxy s4 contains a lots of features but most of them are useless also lock screen of galaxy s4 is extremely slow sometimes it take 34 sec to turn s4 lock screen on after pressing the power button this annoys me a lot this round goes to iphone 5  6 gaming games run smoother on iphone than my galaxy s4 difference is clearly noticeable when you play heavy games obviously it is not noticeable when playing small games iphone 5 wins this one  7 customization no doubt android wins this round ios has almost no customization but i really dont care much about this widgets are almost useless to me as they get refreshed after 12 sec of moving to the window they belong to rooting a device is another benefit with android as there are lot many custom roms available but i really dont have much time to do all these this one goes to galaxy s4  8 media streamingfrom video streaming websites you will not be able to play content from lot many websites on an ios device and streaming will be slower compared to android on many other websites this round goes to galaxy s4 definitely there is a very fast youtube app for ios device but i stream videos from many other websites for which there is no app this makes my s4 as the primary media streaming device  9 ecosystemapps ios has the more polished faster and better quality apps apps have beautiful interface and they are faster too because they run natively and not on top of any dalvik vm as in android because things have to run on top of a dalvik vm in android it can never become faster than ios this one goes to iphone 5  10 looks and usability no doubt iphone 5 looks way better than galaxy s4 also when it comes to ui ios ui is way better looking than android in terms of usability i prefer iphone 5 because it has just the perfect size i prefer to use my phone with 1 hand iphone 5 is just perfect when you want to use a phone on the go iphone 5 is the perfect size for daily use and fits nicely in pocket but smaller screen is not very good for media consumption this round goes to iphone 5  11 hardware definitely ios devices have more powerful hardware also material used is much better in iphone 5 this round goes to iphone 5  please note that i dont favour any of these platforms specifically and i am not biased to any specific platform i use my galaxy s4 for media consumption and iphone for gaming browsing reading news and chat as you can see all have their advantages and disadvantages but i prefer iphone 5 over my galaxy s4 for day to day activities
7966	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	first off i do believe this is overpriced and i would probably not have bought this at a 45k price tag however i ended up getting one without paying for oneprovided by my employer like all apple products very high quality build and a fantastic ios operating system that does not crash mid way this could be missing some fancy features that competition is boasting of but that is easily compensated by the assured reliability this offers i have owned the previous generation of iphones and i have a ipad along with a first gen galaxy note i can tell you from my experience that if price is not a constraint there is no better phone to buy
7967	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	iphone5 is good but not good for battery lifethis is my first apple iphone i like it but not my expectations fulfil apple is not good for those who have not computers and not good in 2g network
7968	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	ive been an apple fan and user since the last 9 years i own an imac mbp ipad ipod and the iphone 3gs recently i upgraded my phone to the iphone 5 its an awesome smartphone but the cellphone signal reception is truly something that has started bothering me a lot while other vodafone users with android and winmo get full signal my calls keep dropping frequently waiting for the ios 7 and hoping that it has some signal boosting feature as well  nirmal biswas 
7969	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	the best phones i ever used its awesome very efficient very easy to use and handle touch is simply superb including the processing speed
7970	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	i was initially excited to take delivery of this iphone 5 but soon discovered that it was the us version this is not an issue in itself if you only plan to use 3g and 2g but it will not be compatible with 4g which is clearly going to be an issue as the 4g coverage in the india begins to expand over the next couple of years  loving this phone compared to my old iphone 4 its noticeably slimmer and much lighter and does look great oh and as for dimensions it shouldnt bother you it certainly hasnt bothered me making the change from the iphone 4 to the iphone 5 its a bit longer but my fingers reach i was hoping that the finish would be hard wearing enough that i didnt need to buy a case for it though as i love the look of the matte white back however it does like the other review mention start to chip and scratch very easily
7971	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	it is a master piece of technology price is high but you know that you are paying for innovation and hard work gone to make this wonderful piece it hurts when you see the same is being copied by making use of legal loopholes and sold cheaply
7972	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	i think its worth the price tag easy to use and has maximum features beautiful screen with high quality camera os 7 is by far best easy to understand and useneed to improve battery backup but really iphone 5 does need any comment
7973	Apple iPhone 5 (White-Silver, 16GB)	its a really high 5 the easy to understand  and handle  suggest to purchase only i phone in future also like to purchase only apple products

7993	Intex Aqua Star HD (Black-Silver)	battry back up is very less compaired with other equivalent handsets other wise the insex aqua star hd is good for the advance use
7994	Intex Aqua Star HD (Black-Silver)	though all the attributes of good delivery were in order i was shocked to find that the ringer speaker of the phone was not working i noticed this about 2 hours later of opening the box as i busy explaining the features to my mother whom i gifted this phone since she stays away and is here for a short visit i didnt have the time to apply for a refundreturn  get a new piece instead i visited the service center which is reasonably close to my place  got the issue fixed which was due to some 34lose connection as mentioned by the technician this kind of an experience is really alarming with intex products  should be addressed with the company  overall performance of phone is good with sharp speed app response  display battery back up  sound quality leave a lot to be desired for

8008	Xolo Q800 (White)	i bought this product around two months back and was waiting to have a good use before writing any feedback i can start by saying that before buying i was very skeptical about the product the company is new in inidan market and is the subbrand of another low cost cell manufacturer i tried to do some online research  review and initial feedback was superb for q800 then i got a chace to speak with a mobile repairing shop and overall feedback about the company was not good at all i go ahead with the purchase because im not a very tech savvy and thought of using a low cost phones before buying a good one after the 2 months use im 34almost34 satisfied with the product and is not thinking of another brand new cell atleast for now now coming to details of the product  pros 1 the size is perfect and it fits in my pocket very well 2 enough ram around 800 mb free gives me opportunity to open multiple apps simultaneously 3 processor is fast 4 touch is responsive 5 sound is not great but nothing to complain for too as you can expect that it wont be the ebst in any way 6 the sensors working fine 7 the box comes with an additional screen guard which is really handy  cons 1 ill start with battery as for all other low cost brands its battery is also not  good it doesnt run for more than 1820 hours im medium  heavy user and prefer to charge once it goes beow 20 2 screen doesnt work best under sunlight unless i make it as most bright 3 gps takes long time to lock if not more than a minute very close to it 4 radio has a problem few cases experience worst  no sound 5 there is no way to close all the running program simultaneously you have to do it one by one  suggestion please go for this product if you 1 rough user eventually you will be paying less for your loss 2 you want to experience the new technology first before investing a lumpsum amount 3 you are not brand faniac
8009	Xolo Q800 (White)	amazon provided this amazing phone at the best of the best price far more discounted price as compared to others the phone has been absolutely superb being using it for more than seven eight months now and never had any issues camera is class speed and specs of the phone actually delivers and not just name sake dual aim works great battery realy last long despite heavy usage in a nutshell xolo is now worth a name to be trusted and they realy make good phone i realy and thoroughly enjoy my phone

8077	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	when the phone was released it cost 50k but one year down the line it is hovering arount 3132k i got the same online for a sale at 28k the phone was a flagship previously and hence is an excellent phone it has since been overtaken by other flagships from htc but manages to hold its ground pretty well if you are looking for a dual sim phone which has cdma as well as gsm then this phone along with htc one e8 are good bets this phone lacks the 4g option so those looking for the same should look at other options  built quality the built quality of this phone is too good the metal body gives a very regal look and feel the phone also feels very sturdy they have given a small removable cover for the insertion of the microsim and the micro sd cards this is very good as it is a comfortable arrangement rather than small flap for insertion of sims  display the display is 47 inches big it is perfect for daily use when compared to some of the 5 inch mobiles on offer today this can just be operated on one hand but we have to be careful as the power button is on the top and little awkward to reach the display is sharp and crisp with good color reproduction and viewing angles  call quality the call quality is top notch the clarity of voice received by us and also the user on other end is very good there is always good reception which helps a lot  sound quality htc mobiles are renowned for their sound quality and the htc one dual sim does not disappoint great clarity from the speakers and great for listening to music watching movies  touch response the touch response is buttery smooth and gives a good user experience  ease of use the phone is relative easy to use some features like blinkfeed may not be liked by everyone so may be enabled or disabled as deemed fit the built in htc diagnostics are also good for shecking for hardware problems there is no bloatware as such  camera the camera leaves something more to be desired the quality of the shots are good but going for 82204 ultrapixel8221 is a gamble which htc took but failed at recent models have replaced this with higher 8220megapixel8221 ratings if you want an excellent camera you may want to steer clear  performance the overall performance of the mobile is good the capable processor with the high ram runs any application with ease multiple applications also do not affect the performance much gaming is also smooth as is browsing and other routine applications  power consumption power consumption used to be a problem with the battery draining fast but with small changes to the settings and recent update the battery life has greatly improved coming for almost one day 1214 hours  overall this is a very good model the one star deducted is for the camera
8078	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	excellent one by htc never lags good enough camera dual front stereo speakers are just superb battery shouldve been a bit more htc one has the lowest battery in this price range phones go for it
8079	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	i am very happy with the designfeelspeed of the phone the sound of the phone is just really good its been 4 days since i got and so far working really well for me as i was tired of handling two phone one for company and one for home now i dont have two charge two phones and carry two phones with me the battery life of the phone is also pretty good
8080	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	good an prompt service by the vendor htc one duel sim is a wonderful phone and very fast to operate
8081	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	i love this phoneextremely fastthe most vibrant screen i have ever seen on a smartphonebetter than s4 or the so hyped i phones retina displaythe sound quality is awesomeheadphone are not very cool looking and sound is decentbattery life is averagelasts upto 12 to 14 hours on full chargecamera quality is very good
8082	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	i bought this from from amazon at 35k great looks and great performance used to get fantabulous feedback from ally colleagues and friends who took this phone in the hands everything was going smooth until the phone stopped charging did all research but nothing helped so submitted the phone for repair it took almost 25 days to get my phone back after that the phone has crashed 2 times and is still under repair my worst phone and bad experience with htc not worth of even 1star
8083	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	this is the perfect high end dual sim phone  with dlna  nfc and cdma support  it has everything one can dream of  i have 3 htc one  802d as its very rear product to get it  excellent phone one should go for it blindly  32 gb internal memory keeps phone running like butter smooth performance  2 gb ram and expandable memory  what else u need   its best looking phone frm htc till date 
8084	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	best phone with dual sim in smart phone category speed is very good apps work fast camera not sure if this is the best one else very convenient no need to carry 2 phones around overall very good experience
8085	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	hats off to the seller the item is a genuine taiwan made as the seller mailed me 100 trusworthy and the phoneits awesom performance feeling much easy to use than apple products i recommend this phone thanks to the seller and amazon
8086	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	just camera should be little betterat least they should give 8 mega pixel camera it takes pics good but due to 4 mega resolution not able catch clear pictures
8087	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	htc one the phone is frequently cited as the best android mobile currently in market and its true when it comes to features and premium but that said theres a difference between a daily use commodity and art piece you cant keep a mobile in a showcase and thats where this mobiles problems lie ill explain the mobile has a very low reparability its very difficult to repair its screen if damaged to repair just the screen costs 20k and that too it is sent to taiwan overall amazing phone i hope they have solved this problem and offer cheaper repairing in india only thus the one star ive cut is due to the above mentioned after sales issues
8088	HTC One (Dual SIM, Silver)	saw the same product on amazon for 39600 a week back and thought of buying it but when saw afterwards the price has been increased to 45500 so waiting for price to come down

8096	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, Black)	an inexpensive smartphone in the xperia series xperia e is yet powerful enough for average mobile phone use  pros the looks are impressive especially with the black variety the features too are nothing mediocre  512 mb ram 1 ghz processor 3g gps accelerometer and android 41 jelly bean the sound quality of music playback is great plays videos upto 720p without a problem i havent tried higher resolutions  cons but the compromise that has been made with screen quality and camera to keep price low does show off obtrusively the screen quality isnt very bad just that the viewing angles arent great but still is satisfactory as long as you dont place it side by side with a samsung duos or an lg optimus the camera works fine in day light but is poor when used in an illlit environment  usage apart from these two compromises there havent been any problems with the phone like hanging or slow down in the past 1 week since i bought this phone from a local dealer but i must say i am not a heavy user and i havent played heavy games on the mobile  if all you want is a simple reliable and sturdy smartphone to browse smoothly through websites to listen to music play a few games watch some videos now and then make use of the android platform for its myriads of apps and if you can trade off with the mediocre screen quality and camera and if you are trying to upgrade from a basic mobile to a smartphone you will be satisfied with this phone the phone is cheaper online than in most retail stores  options if you want consider options then you might want to take a look at the  lg optimus  the  htc desire c  or the  samsung s duos 
8097	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, Black)	hi all  i was searching for a good spec android smartphone for a while and find out sony experia e single sim suitable for me after using it i found the product excellent in its price range excellent performance is the highlight of the smartphone with 2 gb internal and 750 mb phone memory with latest jelly bean  its gives me lot of space for enjoyment sony made compromise on its camera  i prefer this phone to the following peoples   1 who wish to own a branded sony android smart phone within their budget 2 who dont want to use heavy lengthy 434  534 screen size 3 who wish to use the phone while in rush bus heavy traffic or in any busy situation without using both hands  4 to keep in your pockets or in hand so simply  5 who are not much gaming buddy s  6 who wish to enjoy good music  thank you

8104	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, Black)	i have given this rating because i liked the way amazon has provided me time to time feedback regarding delivery of the phone  what i liked is  the punctuality with which the product was delivered well before the time committed even though it was dispatched from mumbai to nashik using best courier service available and since it was my first online purchase i was skeptical about the quality of product being delivered to me but after looking at the packing and the content in it i was pleasantly satisfied with the product only issue is the guaranty card sent is not having been mentioned the details of seller as well as the date of sale giving ambiguity to the guaranty warranty mentioned in the advertisement  i have referred the content in the site to couple of friends who have not ventured into online shopping as of now
8105	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, Black)	amazon online helps in comparing the price and product feature before buying  gives user review too  good experience
8106	Sony Xperia E C1504 (Single SIM, Black)	its good but camera every time we have to change the settings it doesnt have flash light so the clarity of the camera is not much good but the processor and the bance apps are working good

8116	Gionee Elife E3 (Black)	my personal experience is that this phone works nicely for around 1 year after its its starts getting hang and even its touch and display is so nondurable as it can get damage with a low intensity struck  the customer care and service centre is not responsive
8117	Gionee Elife E3 (Black)	i have a mobile   super and best mobile i have seen ever
8118	Gionee Elife E3 (Black)	i bought this mobile before 6 months except battery backup as it is 1800mah i never faced any problem with my mobile the best things i liked is screen clarity its  too good
8119	Gionee Elife E3 (Black)	i bought gionee for the first time before that i had samsung which i used for 35 yrs which a great age for smartphone i received product on thursday night i used the same on friday and had to return it on saturday because of charging issue the phone remains at 1 battery level even charging it for hours also facing some download issues download gets paused and would never continue  pros  1 great look and feel and design build 2 great resolution  cons  1 very poor battery backup used for a day  but still not worth hardly lasts for 1214 hrs for moderate usage no games half day internet few calls very few downloads and almost standby battery goes by nearly 35 in an hour 2 low sound of loudspeaker 3 jelly bean android  not expected a defective phone from gionee
8120	Gionee Elife E3 (Black)	i would rate this phone for five stars but it looses its fifth star due to less battery backup time all over other than battery its fantastic one of all smart phones available in market in rs1300000 range
8121	OPPO Yoyo R2001 (Black)	i am using this phone for the past two weeks  the functions they provide in the phone is really worth the money we payalso this is the only phone which is priceed equally on all sites and outside market this phone is not meant for hard core gamers as the ram is only one gb and the internal storage is also a bit less but for a person who needs only important applications  to run them very fast with all the fetures likke gesturre motions where we can open any app with whatever gesture we set guest log where we have secondary password to open infront of others to hide the necessary applications lock for individual applications qiet time where we can set important calls to go loud wen it rings open applications in lock mode with touch of fingers which we set display too is pretty good as am not a hard core gamer am getting a full day battry back up with intermittent use of wifi and data
8122	OPPO Yoyo R2001 (Black)	i am using this phone last week a very good package in this price range its having different looks os than any other android phones worthy choice
8123	OPPO Yoyo R2001 (Black)	the phone is quite impressive except for the camera which seems to be little low compare to other phones in this segment all other features are excellent
8124	OPPO Yoyo R2001 (Black)	it doesnt worth to pay it price for so low internal memory 604gb i cant install more than few apps on this phoneplease google for app installation issues for this phone
8125	OPPO Yoyo R2001 (Black)	good build quality  design oppo usually provides less powerful configurations for the price paid but this phone is decently powerful ram screen size is good the main usp of oppo phones is os ie user interface which you can only feel after using the phone but if you are camera lover  willing to pay more then for rs3000 more oppo find 5 mini will suit you better as it clicks better pictures
8126	OPPO Yoyo R2001 (Black)	i bought this phone and features are different from other smart phones and look is also nice speed is good and camera quality is superb recommend to buy this mobile 
8127	OPPO Yoyo R2001 (Black)	nice fon

8258	Gionee Pioneer P2 (Black)	good phone at this value battery life is avreage and camera quality is also avreage taking time to load home screen either you have choosen default launcher or go launcher temple run2 robocop games played easily on this mobile without any lagging ram is always 85 is in used
8259	Gionee Pioneer P2 (Black)	i liked the product its value for money got all the features at 55k  only stuggle some time feel on ram which is 512 and camera quality only challenge was poor corrdination of amezon with seller and customer they are just providing a online platform nothing else

8263	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	this is a cool phone  i agree with the prior reviews  i have had nine for 3 months it has the features i wanted and some good one i didnt expect the battery goes a long time and the lenovo battery charger works faster then any other i have had  charged 40 in one hour i wanted loud phone  sound to use google translate and it is loud and clear  ok sound to listen to music or movie while traveling no bass but enjoyable to hear when i travel this will replace my macbook which now seems very heavy movies are good with headphones build is solid the back plastic feels like metal not soft and is not slippery kit kat upgrade went smoothly worth the price and i have recently seen it even lower look around not too big in my hand or pocket except for one pair of shorts might be too big for a small hand i would rather have this phone and the money difference then a iphone 6 cons  screen could be brighter with a large phone you cant hold the speaker and phone close to your ear and mouth at the same time  sometimes the mic will move away and volume will be low on the other side much prefer the lenovo to my old samsung galexy s3 which seems small now
8264	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	this phone is simply awesome  pros 1 6inch display hd viewing pleasure to watch movies and videos 2 light weight lighter than any other 6inch phones in market 3 big battery 3000mah u can watch more than 3 movies with full charge and play games and use wifi 4 i always keep my wifi and 3g turned on10hrs wifi and 14hrs 3g  still the battery lasts for 1day with full charge 5dolby sound and dual speakers are amazing 6 good quality earphones with tangle free flat cable 7 1gb and quadcore processor helps u to play large memory games and multi taskingasphalt 8 with no lag  8 upgradable to kit kat 442 9 customized lenovo smart features such as autoanswer and mercury dail pad  for 1hand operation  cons 1 accessories are not widely available in stores case cover with kick stand not flip cover with stand is not available even in online stores 2 it fits in pockets but should be very very careful big screen lovers can ignore this   
8265	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	excellent shipping by amazon received on 2nd day  its been only 2 days since i am using the phone and the experience has been excellent lenovo has created a marvelous phone it is very fast never hanged in 2 days camera is decent and looks are good  only thing where lonovo has made a mistake and a big mistake i would say since they marred the joy of otherwise an excellent phone is they saved money on the back lidcover of the phone it is such a cheap quality plastic that i was afraid of breaking it when i was opening it the first time to fit battery inside why save 50 rs on the backlid when you invested so much on the rest of the phone does lenovo realize that the number of little locks they have added to the cheap plastic backlid even if 1 of them breaks the backlid will be loose forever no one can fix it then do you guys sell back covers in the market how to get it if it break is any lonovo staff member listening  i have given 4 stars due to this factor otherwise it is a very good phone
8266	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	using it only for the past couple of days at the time of writing this review but the product is good simple efficient and classy again lenovo has not incorporated micro sim slots so one needs to use sim adapters phone is quite lightweight despite its size note 2 was slightly heavier in comparison my suggestion wud b to order a nice grip back cover i doubt this phone will last 2 or more falls
8267	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	pretty neat phone extremely sleek not of high quality as sony or highend htcs but for the price its been really good i get 2 days battery with average use and it charges up without much delay unlike my previous samsung tab 4 stereo speakers are superloud but lacks quality bass like moto g 2nd gen display is very nice but legibility under the sun may not be good call quality is pretty good ear piece is loudalthough it leaks sound at high volume performance is fairly decent for the price lots of sensors some of which are quite useful if you dont use flip cover quality of parts do not match expensive brands probably because it is not expensive like them obviously overall its been running pretty smooth for a month now i have to mention about its sleekness again its so super light and so slim if this phone lasts more than 15 months ill probably buy another lenovo since most of its models are value for money but they must last
8268	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	looks are good battery life is good charging time is good you cannot place it in any pocket no info on upgrade from 42 to 44 from lenovo
8269	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	lenovo s 930 is a very beatiful machine with aesthetic craftsmanship it has a very beautiful front sexy back exceptional sound quality from duel front speakers with dolby digital supportgood frontback cameradurable long lasting batteryvery good call qualityaverage screenfunctions with out laglight weightlenova made this for men with big palmfingersmain disadvantage is lack of native video calling which samsung has  prosverygood sound qualitylong lasting batteryconsabsence of native video calling facilityexcellent dealingbefore time delivery of my amazonenow today 23122014i found that s 930 has native video calling facility by long touching the the contact nooptions including video call appears touch required option enjoy native video call
8270	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	fantastic product the most durable battery i have ever seen on a phablet believe or not with moderate to light usage battery for me is lasting for 78 days without the need to charge phone is beautiful with crisp display doesnt feel like 720p fantastic sound quality dolby is very handy though bass output is limited incredibly light weight distribution of wieght is fantastic for phablet of this size overall a recommended phablet
8271	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	guys i jst buy fro amazone the mobile is outstanding who like bigscreen the sound quality is amazing i just compared with htc 816g   i felt more sound than htc and the camera is better than htc desire 816geven though  lenovo provide  8mprear 17selfie on other hand htc have 13 mprear 5 mpselfie but  lenovo wins camera paer and sound quality so u can buy blindly if u get below 1500000
8272	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	worth the moneyit delivers what it saysif you are not that guy who opens 10 apps at a time then the 1gb ram is more than sufficient also the battery back up is quite good a small recommendation do buy a case cover along with it as the phone is pretty light and it may get damaged if it falls from your hand without any protectionthanks
8273	Lenovo S930 (Silver)	product is really good with loads of features yet to explore many but good as far as it is explored positives include responsive touch big display good rear camera negatives  call reception quality could have been better

8341	Micromax Canvas Fun A76 (Blue)	i loved the product  a76 fun is aptly named i have been using this phone from the last one month some of my colleagues after seeing my phone  testing it  loved it and 3 people bought it on the same day it was ordered by them during gosf2013 and they got an amazing deal at price of 6000 rs i ordered from amazon for 7375 rs and i have no regrets amazing touch  superb display hd quality sound from the speaker for people willing to buy the phone  i would say buy immediately for those looking at the best deal in the market i would suggest  try the micromax juice a77  similar specs but 1 gig ram rest of the phone its amazing  you can use 3g  edge you would need to purchase a good quality ear plug for the same  have not tried the one in the box i tried apple ear plugs but the music quality is ok using ones from beats audio  the sound quality is fantastic you have all the features that any other android manufacturer provide with the best price go for it

8344	Micromax Canvas Fun A76 (Blue)	i m using a76 since sep 2013 and till now 2015 its working fine xcept front camera it is 003 mp  and battery backup still good

8347	Micromax Canvas Fun A76 (Blue)	good item reached in time expected  quick dispatch  very good packingkeep it up i love it keep on the good work
8348	Micromax Canvas Fun A76 (Blue)	micromax has stopped servicing mobile phones from what i gather all the numbers listed on their siteare outdated i have a micromax a78 and this is a general review the phones are great for their price range but your problems start after a year when small parts of your mobile start failing and you have to sell your soul to the demons to get the spare parts and you have to pay the exorbitant prices quoted by your local mobile shop dealer because there is no other source you can compare these prices to  if you are looking for a reliable long lasting smart phone micromax is not advisable this is not my personal opinion as i had the rare fortune of visiting a service center in bangalore early this year and i talked to at least a dozen people who had to pay the whole amount as their guarantee period had just ended the center is not servicing for micromax anymore  other than that the battery lasts a good 68 hours depending on the amount of usage the processor is a bit slow for my requirement but given the price range it is decent enough it is strongly built i have dropped it 23 times already i have had to replace the charging pin battery
8349	Micromax Canvas Fun A76 (Blue)	first android got no problems using since a year
8350	Micromax Canvas Fun A76 (Blue)	ill talk about the cons first because they are really annoying me right now  1 viewing angles are good sideways but very bad from top and bottom so if you are playing games in landscape orientation then it will cause you headaches as the screen gets blackened with slightest of tilt  2 cameras both are nothing but jokes no other words  3 headphones which look impressive dont sound that well but maybe they are new and i should run them in burnin period for around 100 hours and then their quality might improve its not a con actually but i felt it was worth mentioning  thats it with the cons there are plenty of good things and ill not highlight them in points form but in paragraph style because theres plenty to write about  the main highlight of this phone is the design which is just fantastic the build quality looks premium and youll feel very nice to hold this phone in your hands because of the impressive design the phone feels a lot slimmer than it actually is nice job by mmx in this department my phone doesnt heat that much as mentioned by other reviewers design build quality and hardware all are pretty solid  hardware pretty impressive for a budget phone specs are 13 ghz dual core and not 12 ghz as mentioned fwvga 5 inch screen with 5 point multitouch pretty good loudspeaker and crisp clear sound ram 512 mb and free ram around 230 mb which is excellent i must say  the screen is sharp and vivid though the resolution is low and bad viewing angles it is smooth and touch response is just perfect the colours are 167 millions while youll get at the most 262k colours in similar budget phones  as mentioned earlier lots of high graphics games are supported and all the basic games and apps have no issues at all high graphic games like nova 3 modern combat 4 asphalt 7  8 real racing 3 and even fifa 2014 run pretty good and i am impressed with the performance no problems with apps and performance whatever works does work very well without any issues internal memory for apps is more than 1 gb so no need to worry about internal memory and no need to move apps to sdcard also game data is stored on external micro sdcard so thats excellent and worth mentioning  android jelly bean 422 butter smooth latest version is there so we need not worry about latest os and all  hd and full hd videos are supported in hardware mode in mx player internet speed is good in all modes eg wifi 3g and even 2g comes with two screen guards out of which one is already applied on phone funny thing mine which was already applied on the phone went off while i tried to remove protective film so had to use other screen guard  when compared to its sibling canvas fun a74 it is a much better deal because 1 a74 screen size is 45 inch a76 is 5 incher 2 a74 supports 3 finger multitouch a76 has 5 finger multitouch 3 battery of a74 is 1500 mah a76 has 2000 mah rest all the things are same  nenamark 2 score is 40 fps antutu is 9600 quadrant is 3900  this is my 7th android phone in past 4 years and i am pretty much happy with it and id suggest you all to buy this instead of other brand phones in similar budget as the services of mmx have really improved nowadays while im fed up with after sales services from brands like karbonn xolo and even samsung
8351	Micromax Canvas Fun A76 (Blue)	mmex cnvas a76 is very gud
8352	Micromax X279i (Black)	delivered on time and in this money range item is just okkkk

8355	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	i was one of the first ones to purchase a phone from amazon india i ordered the first day they started selling phones online i must admit that there was a little apprehension though they are a great brand in india i had never bought from them i was greatly surprised when i received the product in 2 days thanks amazon  now coming to the phone i have been using it for about a month now i am extremely happy with its performance it has never crashed till date looks are stunning the phone comes with wonderful set of loaded apps i use this extensively for data music apart from voice conversations the phone has a noise minimization feature which helps you to have a good conversation in a crowded area  overall i am very very happy with this product hence given this 5 stars 
8356	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	with almost all features including nfc and all you get everything in this phone ui is fast so no issues with that  only 2 concerns internal memory is only 58gb 4gb only for apps battery is bit on the lower side but still gets you an entire day thats pretty good value for money
8357	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	bought this phone on 24 oct 2013 from amazon received it in 3 days for only 13499 rs it is an excellent phone to use no lag like samsung mobile phones in this or higher rangegreat quality camera and user interfacehave been getting the latest updates on time from sony no issues till now worth buying this phone at the present price range better then most of the competition in the market right nowthumbs up sony and amazon
8358	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	this phone has great features especially the hdr feature is very catchy worth a buy ive already given a 5 star for this  for battery drain  there are many battery apps in the play store which reduces the battery flow and enhances the performance for the phone
8359	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	great delivery  thanks to amazon for that ran well i am using it for a month or so  its a very good smartphone having all the basic features pros  good processor  good call quality  good display  lag free  cons camera needs a lot of improvement  restarted on its own for 2 times  battery drains quickly  faced a few touchscreen problem  memory limited only 4 gb of user memory available  runs pretty well on 412 but full of bugs in 422 
8360	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	the good   looks amazing and has a unique curved back that fits neatly in your hands good clarity display sound quality and battery life while just playing music is great  the bad   performance unable to handle multiple applications running in parallel battery life when 3g is on  and the ugly   the rear camera takes very grainy pics during the night front camera is useless at any time
8361	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	the photo of the phone showing here is not sony xperia l its sony xperia m i cant risk buying this
8362	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	am writing this review after using this phone for 1 year its a smart  superb phone  but u wil get a better phn for this price having more features  but we must pay high for the brand   its main negatives are frnt cam is 03 pxl then only 4gb internal   and the phn has a hang after the usage of 1 yr
8363	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	hi  i bought this for my mother with all the basic features  its very handy and loaded with apps  easy interface for the elderly happy with the phone
8364	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	pretty good product looks great  solid build  1gb ram so i never found any lag in performance  there are a lot of other phones with better specs but i found all those chinese and indian company phones gets very hot during long calls  but sony xperia l is really nice and i really love it best phone in below 15k budget
8365	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	i really got a got a good deal on this for 13k from amazon thanks for that the product reached in 3 days at cochin but the product didnt reach my expectations  pros great main camera good options night photos under light are good light weight display is good no lags  cons poor front vga camera wont recognize anything unless in broad daylight battery  even with stamina mode latest software updates low brightness no auto updates no continuous internet and moderate usage  i have to charge my phone every night charging time is 34 hours i previously had htc which used to charge in less than 15 hours tried a few battery drain apps with no success after reading some reviews in gsm arena i expected around 15 days atleast when the phone is new speaker volume is low to avoid radiation i try using the speaker most often but not with this phone  serious issues internal memory  with not many apps and 12 games the internal storage comes as zero quite frequently after this most of my apps dont work the only solution is to clear internal storage memory after which i get back 4gb of internal memory this way i lose some installed apps and most app data what is the point in having a smart phone when i cant keep some history this problem of zero internal memory comes at least 34 times in a week  considering the deal it was a great bargain but i am returning this phone hopefully will get the full refund
8366	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	after a great confusion about which one to buy and which one not to consider i finally got my sony xperia l i should say a great purchase as this is my 1st android phone and i am pretty much happy with its performance just that a few issues faced in terms of sd card detection and logging out from mails which was solved with the help of sony customer care the battery is a concern but may be most people would not mind as android phones are like that
8367	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	i had bought xperia l through amazontheir service is nice and this model is far away better than xperia c
8368	Sony Xperia L C2104 (Diamond White)	its no too much bad but not that much good also hitting too much restarting after upgrade some time hangs

8378	Lenovo S820 (White, 8GB)	got a good deal for this mobile from amazon great value for money has everything i was looking for in a mobile very happy except for the screen size which is a handful i am not a big fan of oversized mobiles other cons are lack of magnetic sensor  and non backlit navigation buttons i dont mind both one minor complaint against lenovo phones is that the call summary doesnt show after you make a call but installing a third party app called ussd to notification solves this and you get a history of all your notifications
8379	Lenovo S820 (White, 8GB)	its been few month that i got this amazon delivery excellent  phone is also excellent most of them doesnt know this brand but its really good phone to buy i recommended this to few of my friends has all the useful features which are beyond the normal benefits that normally comes with this range of phones unless if you are a tech savy  i recommend this for any of you who would like to buy this
8380	Lenovo S820 (White, 8GB)	ordered a 8gb phone but got a 4gb one and there s no exchange optionphone is not bad but camera is not tat great cause its a 13mp one but still not fine
8381	Lenovo S820 (White, 8GB)	its hangs sometimes and does not look like it has an 1 gb ram also you cannot compare the camera clarity with samsung or nokia its not a great phone but still look wise i give it a 5 and performance wise i give it a 2
8382	Lenovo S820 (White, 8GB)	this phone is really awesome firstly the best features at this price camera is very good both front and back gui is also very good it worth buying something new rather than using regular samsung one in fact i compared it with moto g also but looks are better for lenovo very slim less weight and handy  only drawback is power off button is at top which is manageable battery i was looking for full day work which is ok with 2 sims also overall worth the price and one must go for it if budget is around 1415 k
8383	Lenovo S820 (White, 8GB)	dear friends lenovo has given the best phones in the market but its service is very poor and very costly so please insure your phone its the best idea if are going with lenovo
8384	Lenovo S820 (White, 8GB)	its value for money best buy in 1015k range pros performance battery design dual sim cons built quality only 6gb internal memory is available for use

8387	Lenovo S820 (White, 8GB)	pro  looks  slim good sound qualitiy smooth performance good camera both features smart answer place the phone near your ear to recieve call flip to mute any many more  cons  image quality is not great in low light u have to charge it everyday  i love every bit of it  i recommend it

8390	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	i purchased the gionee m2 from amezonin 3 days back   it is good phone  value for money of course i used it for 3 days only  good processor good design multiple applications the browser should have been other easy to handle phone packing by the supplier was not up to the markit should have been better with good protective for the pack of costly smartphone

8392	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	have been using this phone for the last six months everything is good as everyone else would have commented two things which i observed were  1 the music output is very good when it comes the sound level but the softness of the sound misses and that may be harmful to the ears however when i used a sony headphone which is about rs1000 it was good 2 the bluetooth quality  i connected the plantronics voyager to m2 and when i join the meetings people say that my voice is very low and they cannot hear me when i connect the same plantronics to my blackberry and take up the same call the next a comment from my friend said it was loud and clear on the overall for a normal person and a mid level management guys its an awesome phone especially when you browse on the move for the senior executives where you take up calls for about 7 to 8 hours a day the battery in m2 is sweet but these bluetooth quality is a challenge

8394	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	after using for one month the back cancell is button is not functioning  after making  several calls to gionee toll free no they suggested me to give the phone to nearest service center as i am residing at port blair andaman and nicobar islands i find it very difficult to reach the nearest service station at main land  a kind request to amazone pls  do not send such items through online shopping which doesnt have a authorised service center at that location
8395	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	an excellent mobile gioenee customer care service centres are also very helpful  much better than phones of micromax and samsung in this price range micromax customer care centres are dumb and careless  a must buy product thanks amazon  gionee

8398	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	phone is overall good with high end configuration and compared to price 1 star is less given because its heavy phone  main feature is its 8px camera and high capacity battery of 4500 mah
8399	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	it is same as any other android phone but at reduced cost looks wise it is ok but works absolutely fine phone is stable  doesnt hang
8400	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	phone looks and works well only disadvantage is bulky but you will get bigger battery with long lasting charge camera seems not up to the mark

8402	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	pure value for money phone only drawback is it doesnt have music equalizer but that also can be resolved by downloading fusion player all over its a best phone in 10 k
8403	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	awesome battery life  gaming experience no regrets for this phone purchase i experienced 5 days of battery back up with this handset

8405	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	service by amzone is very good the audio jack is not working no service centre available in thane are after sale service is very poor
8406	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	amazon online purchase is best and gionee backup time is best and its loks also goodonly weight is slight more than normal phone
8407	Gionee M2 (White, 4GB)	best phone under this budget go for it battery is outstanding good than other smartphone but not like what 4200mh should deliver
8408	Intex Aqua Star Power Smart Android Kitkat Mobile phone - Black	hi i am currently using this mobile from more then 25 days  battery backup is good it easily last for 1 day even after  watching 2 movies  battery remains by 23 at the end of the day  camera quality has also improved as compared to past intex available products video quality is good easily connect to the computerlaptop and share the files videos as an when require it has otg cable support where data can be easily transfer to pendrive as per the requirement music sound quality is good and loud without headphone except for in comming call tunes one major problem is flip cover is not available for intex aqua star power have tried a lot  pls let me know if available prshntnyk9yahoocoin

8422	Gionee Ctrl V5 (Black)	i recently purchased a gionee v5 from amazon i found it an excellent phone for a very reasonable price it has the look of a highend phone with attractive slim design it fast and battery life is good surprisingly it came with a good quality flipcover 8 mp primary camera gives excellent pictures but the secondary camera is not so good i like the torch in it overall its worth for the money spent

8448	HTC One M8 (Glacial Silver)	a drawback of getting the iphone 6 is that it is very slippery i mean it is virtually unusable without a case since it keeps slipping from my hand i own both phones the htc one m8 is the 34snappiest34 experience when looking to zip through something i love htc sense ui and have always preferred it over other androids since its really less cluttered ive disabled blinkfeed there are some features that this phone offers that make me like it a lot im going to enlist them now and then what i dont like too much  features pros  1 the screen is a delight to look at and if you were to ever take a video while driving or being driven through fields and hills this phone can be pretty good for shooting videos 2 it takes very long to completely charge and the charging is slow but you know what that means right the battery life is very very good in comparison with the iphone 6 i found both phones last me a day at the very least with normal usage 3 the boom sound speakers are good notice i didnt say great why the sound can be too obtrusive at times and maybe a tad hollow yes its louder than the iphone 6 but the iphone 6 for some reason sounds crisp to me and almost as loud if you are the kind of person who pays a lot of attention to voice and lyrics the one m8 doesnt really shine through and needs a touch of refinement 4 comes with a case of acceptable quality a little silicone case 5 the interface is very very fast and watching youtube videos on this is a pleasure especially when you are trying to hear someone 34speak34 not sing 6 call quality is amazing ive used other htcs in the past and that was thing i hated about all of them the call quality i never understood how they couldnt get such a simple thing right but now that htc has finally made the loud speaker the microphone and everything else so responsive i cant complain anymore 7 future proof but where is lollipop  8 build quality is supreme and maybe the best out there despite being almost a year old  consareas where they could improve  1 it could charge faster 2 in the interface there is some confusion over power save and brightness i wish they would do away with it 3 sometimes the browser opens and the page isnt instantly customized 4 bad keyboard typing experience takes time to get used to 5 irritating ring tones and vibration patters by default 6 the main camera is belowindustryaverage and should be bigger brighter and not oversaturate certain reds and greens halos  yes i am nitpicking but why shouldnt i youre spending a lot of money on this phone so why not  this makes the best choice over the androids because of build quality call quality battery life beautiful interface and excellent availibility of apps  i prefer this over samsungs touchwiz because there is less clutter and it is easier to adapt to  excellent multimedia experience overall make this is a worthy purchase
8449	HTC One M8 (Glacial Silver)	device is fantastic no doubt using it second time  first one was bought on launch date and it was gray  i wanted silver but went with whatever was available that time after 6 mo sold it and bought silver now in gosf and it was a nice deal

8454	HTC One M8 (Glacial Silver)	htc phones are just awesome you can even compare it with an iphone8230 i had an htc one x one of the best phone i have owned8230 till it decided to break down on me just after 1 year and 2 months usage it started to reboot randomly and i took the phone to the htc authorized service center in the hope of getting it fixed by changing the battery or so8230 the service center gave me the shock of my life saying the complaint is on the board and the replacement will cost rs17000 the fact that the warranty expired just 2 months ago didn8217t help on googling a bit i found that htc is known to have board issues and i am the latest victim so guys take my word8230 do not buy htc phones unless off course you want to trade it for another phone within the warranty period it will give up on you and no one will be able help you

8464	LG G Pro Lite D686 (Dual SIM, Black)	i have purchased this product after so many negative feedback but now i can say that my decision was 100 right the most important pros for this product in my view are 1 battery lasts greater than my expectation great battery backup 2 it didnt hurt my sim card normal sim card 3 it didnt hanged yet i am not a gamer i mostly use internet and some of the applications 4 i didnt expect much from its camera but it does its job well except in the case of low light 5 price great value for money  i cannot find much cons for this product the only thing i feel is the absence of a gorilla glass i dont like gaming and not like to test one at least so i dont know the performance of high end games in it
8465	LG G Pro Lite D686 (Dual SIM, Black)	the build quality is really good the gaps are even and everything fits accurately besides that the device proves to be very stiff the pro lite only makes a quiet creaking noise

8485	Karbonn A21 Plus (Black)	worst thing its is hanging because if its processor
8486	Karbonn Sparkle V (Red)	android one is a project by google to make affordable technology available to the masses  the phones are made to an exacting specification laid down by google and there are currently three companies in india supplying the phones viz karbonn micromax and spice  i have already purchased two of the micromax android one phones and now i am the proud owner of the karbonn model  the specification of all three phones is identical and the only difference between the karbonn and micromax is the logo and the escutcheon around the rear camera  i prefer the karbonn  this red model is identical to the black except the removable back is a shocking bright red i wanted this so that i could easliy tell my phones apart and boy does this fluorescent red do the trick  the specification of the phone is top notch and i have never had any lag delay crashing or any other technical issue with the phone  a 32 gb sd card can be added the phone came supplied with an 8 gb card  it needs a memory card or the camera will not save photos which makes it an excellent choice as a music player or for watching movies if you dont have a tv  satellite navigation gps skype apps everything works perfectly and this phone is definitely worth buying even at double the price
8487	Karbonn Sparkle V (Red)	karbonn sparkle v is an android one device released along with other androidone devices from spice and micromax since this is build on googles reference design all these devices have the same internal specs only the outward looks change  whats in the box  phonebatteryscreen guardchargerheadphones not inear   display  ips display with good viewing angles and is pleasing to look at even though the ppi is low no complains  looks and build quality  the back panel is not matte finished rather it has a smooth panel and is not that grippy the front of the device is almost identical to other first gen android one devices build quality is ok for the price the phone is quite heavy which is surprising as it only has a small 1700mah battery inside  software and performance  this comes with android 444 out of the box and is expected to get android l update by the end of january google is promising 2 years of software support which is great for the price overall performance of the device is good hardly saw any lags while multitasking mediatek mt6582 quadcore performs quite well and you can play many popular games without any issues  camera  both cameras are just average nothing to get excited about  battery this only has a 1700mah battery which wont last a full day of use if you use internet often this is in my opinion the biggest issue with these androidone devices to get better backup from this small battery use art runtime  google search to know how to switch to art from dalvik  hopefully we can expect further battery improvements in the upcoming android l ota for this device  storage  4gb internal around 25gb available you cannot choose default app install location as the sdcard but you can move supported apps to sdcard otg is not supported  verdict  i bought this solely for the 2 year software support from google if you dont care about updates you can get better devices under 10k range in india now if you have access to a charging port alwayslike a laptop or a pc the small battery is not that big a concernnext gen androidone devices are coming first quarter of 2015with better specs and hopefully a bigger batteryi would recommend waiting for those if smaller battery and a low resolution display is an issue for you
8488	Karbonn Sparkle V (Red)	consif you are reading this review that means that you are planning to buy this phonea normal person will buy this phone because it is from google so its build quality will be goodi am using the phone since octoberand i dont find anything that a google phone hasyou wont believe but when i play asphalt 8 on this phoneit gets heated as someone has put it on fireheating issues are not only while playing heavy gamesit also gets heated if you talk for long hoursbattery backup is also an issueonly 5 to 6 hours after fully charged  prosthis phone has a very good scope of developmentif you will install custom roms on the device it is a very nice device in that aspectalso it never hangscamera is also good  suggestionif you want to buy a low budget phone that gets ota updates then do not buy thisbuy a motorola
8489	Karbonn Sparkle V (Red)	performs well got the lollipop update before my cousin did on his nexus 6 smooth  lag free performance i dont use the device for gaming though hence i cant comment on gaming performance camera performance is average and u need to insert a micro sd card to strt clicking pics battery life is pretty good and im able to use it through the day without looking around for a charger to plug into as for looks and people were shocked when i told them the device retails for around 5k
8490	Karbonn Sparkle V (Red)	i bought this phone by end feb 2015  until now it works fine to our fullest satisfaction it is really worth of the price we paid for this phone
8491	Karbonn Sparkle V (Red)	its an awesome smart phone feels good in our hand very handy and decent rear and front camera the best thing about this product is basic functionality is suberb zero lagging  lollypop update makes the ui very user friendly touch is very smooth  it has a good battery life google and karbonn have successfully achieved their goal in android one programme
8492	Karbonn Sparkle V (Red)	battery backup is low not user friendly overall ok for this price
8493	Karbonn Sparkle V (Red)	good product at great price delivery was very fast too
8494	Karbonn Sparkle V (Red)	very bad quality phone the build quality is average  think twice before choosing this product  the battery is bad and after sales service is worst my phone worked well for 6 months after which it stopped working  and when i went to service centre  they are claiming that the mother board is affected due to water clogging and it may be because of sweat and made the warranty void and gave an estimate of 35 k for repair

8500	Karbonn Smart A26 (White-Silver)	this was first time i bought such expensive item on internet on amazon and found it defective due to which i am feeling like i should not buy anything from internet since it will be defective each time these things which can easily identified should not be leaved from the sellers eyes
8501	Karbonn Smart A26 (White-Silver)	i have purchased karbonn a 26 from amazonin and i got it as expected the camera as everyone is talking about is actually quite good if you look at pictures on a bigger screen it is a feature loaded phone with most currently prevailing apps and the internet speed is just alright the screen looks very big the touch screen is responsive and good for the price all in all i would recommend this phone to students and early professionals as it would do most of their tasks

8514	Micromax Canvas HD A116 (White)	all those looking to buy this phone must first try and find there nearest service centers just go and visit there once and talk to the people there you had be surprised how few service centers are there and how much time in months it takes to get the phone repaired even new ones if you cant take this much trouble then just search for micromax complaints on google before buying  a hassled customer  did not buy it from amazon
8515	Micromax Canvas HD A116 (White)	awesome phoneworth buying it cambuildlook all are just fabulousno lags only one small issue is that sound qualiy is quite low in speakers but if you use earfones or anyother walkman series earfnes sound is a blast dont think its mmx so u shud not buyjus buy itits awesum

8517	Micromax Canvas HD A116 (White)	i have been using the phone for more than 4 months and i have recommended to many of my friends  colleagues this is a very good device with the best performance in this price range  it is even better than the latest canvas 4 and i have checked that out as well i am not saying that this device has no problems but they are negligible  only problem i have faced is using the flipboard app the ui crashes and you have to go to safe mode and uninstall flipboard this is better than phones that are priced around 20k and i suggest you not to think twice and just get it
8518	Micromax Canvas HD A116 (White)	your packages k bt headset and charger damaged i cant changed  mobile still works awesome  price of the mobile very less compared than others
8519	Micromax Canvas HD A116 (White)	overall i am kind of satisfied with the product here are the good things based on the price that i paid 1 performancewise good i dont play games on mobile devices so cannot judge in terms of games 2 screen clarity and display is pretty good 3 call volume and incoming calls seem to be in good quality my side 4 build quality is good if you compare with what you paid 5 camera performance and picture not bad 6 wifi and personal hotspot works great  bad things 1 has weird issue while charging the phone i had to try 1015 times to successfully unlock my phone through security pattern while charging for some reason it always hits the wrong nodes or misunderstands my swipe while charging 2 people always complain about my voice breaking other side or not able to hear me properly while on the call 3 battery drains out pretty quickly 4 i normally charge my phone whole night and when next morning i undock and start reading news or check my emails for 15 mins battery life drops to around 75 pretty weird may be battery display is not correct
8520	Micromax Canvas HD A116 (White)	friend do not buy micromax canvas hd i have bad experience with this with in 1 and half years the mother board got failed and to replace they are asking rs5000 for this there is no any warranty as you know friends if we spend another 2000 we are getting good mobiles in the market with same configurations i hope all micromax had same condition

in size with full hd screen  powerful soc 5 inch screen with full hd resolution is kind of sweet spot one plus one was not available in india during october 2014 it was coming on amazon in december 2014 but i didnt wanted to wait that long so my options in oct 2014 were e8 moto x 2014 s5 lenovo vibe z2 pro  oppo find 7 considering the size weight aesthetics screen size  resolution boom sound 128 gb expandable  most imp of all dual sim i decided to go with e8 grey color looked very dull red attracts lot of attention so bought white bought it from te moe ste for 32k also bought amazer tpu case

works fine on other devices 8due to glossy finish phone attracts lot of dust  fingerprints also gets scratched easily 9only two colored notification led not multi colored like nexus devices 10the earbuds red colored comes with headset doesnt give good fit i have tried all sizes now i have put sony earbuds  the ugly 1camera auto white balance sucks big times  it8217s not that wide 2no optical image stabilizer nor the 2k or 4k video recording 3front 5mp camera is not wide enough for selphys 4the black strip with htc logo at the end of screen which unnecessary increases height of the phone 5awkwardly placed screen on offpower button 6i have inserted 32gb class 10 sandisk micro sd card sometimes unexpectedly card gets unreadable  then immediately phone reads it again in between this lot

are 1800  2100  2500  e8 is released in june 2014 worldwide  got available in india in around julyaugust 2014 as of march 2015 e8 faces some serious competition one plus one  mi4 are available via online retailers for much lesser price one plus one will be good deal then mi4 if you are on budget moto x 2nd generation 32 gb is also good deal if you don8217t mind the nonexpandable slot and want to get vanilla android experience z2  z3 are waterproof options z3 is good phone but sony is planning to sell their mobile business because of losses also z3 cost lot more and z4 is around the corner if you have high budget then look for flagships like m9 m8 nexus 6 s6 note 4 if you have budget of 3032k then you will have to choose from s5 moto x 2nd generation  e8 not considered other phones from chinese manufactures all have their pluses  minuses e8 holds its own ground with boom sound dual sim 128 gb expandable option better battery  screen moto x biggest merits will be 4k recording and fast android updates s5 has better camera more sensors but doesn8217t have 801soc and have heavy touch wiz ui i think e8 is a good deal for 3031k and you can get it in shops as some people not comfortable with online transactions i am totally satisfied with my purchase and ya the phone totally is worth it   amazer pudding case i also bought amazer case from amazon for 549 it8217s a light case comes in black color with precision cutouts protects phone well as i dropped phone 23 times from 34 feet made up of tpu material totally worth it  thanks for your time and patience

8551	Xolo Q1000 (White)	i received a defective item and on first usage itself there was issue with display of the phone moving from one screen to another deleting photos taken etc we contacted seller saholic and were instructed to get a doa  dead on arrival  certificate from service center only 2 in bangalore on contacting and visiting one of the service centers and waiting for almost an hour we were intimated that they were unable to process the doa as the server is down and were asked to revisit them to collect the certificate it is too tedious process to run around the city seeking for doa seller saholic has been very irresponsible in supporting when it comes to such issue and support provided is very pathetic we have paid full amount for a defective product and unable to claim back the procedure of refund is too tedious
8552	Xolo Q1000 (White)	hi after going through tons of phones and phablets in this price range and after a lot of debates that i had on buying a xolo q1000 canvas hd or the likes i finally finalized on this phone and let me tell u i am totally satisfied while many still argue that micromax is a better brand then here is what xolo has better its the overall build quality screen dragontail and the user experience beleive me when i say canvas hd looks like a cheap china phone in front of xolo q1000 which has a very premium look this coupled with a flip cover case u r all set to enjoy its awesomeness a battery with 100 charge can last for about 3233 hours with normal usage even on 3g network for the entire duration  disadvantages could be that q1000 is a bit bulky and gps locking takes time but then at this price range there are some compromisesand haan even canvas hd or the likes have gps locking issues p overall i m thouroughly satisfied with this phone and would defiintely recommend any1 who wants a budget hd resolution phablet you may have heard k aftersales service of xolo is bad but then again whose is good  all the best  xolo lelo

8556	Xolo Q1000 (White)	nice phone internal memory should have been at least 8 gb because the phones os eats up much of the internal 4gb it has gotalso it needs slightly better battery otherwise a very good phone and good build quality ips display is a big advantage 720p is pretty awesome and the colors look true and running youtube 720p videos make you jump with the clarity you get
8557	Xolo Q1000 (White)	good phone for those days   just sold it few days ago and bough xolo play 1100 xolo phones are good but you must check phone thoroughly before buyingthese phones are prone to have issues with gps bluetooth wifi radio etc

8559	Xolo Q1000 (White)	very smoothlagfree and sturdy handset even if i play any game it doesnt give any lag really was  a value for money phone
8560	Xolo Q1000 (White)	i thought i got the best deal out of amazon but when i openedswitched on the hand set it started behaving abnormally later when i called up amazon they asked me to return the piece and refund the money  and there is no piece replacement my question why to refund the money i could go to any store in order to save the time if the piece got defected then again amazon should have replaced it i didnt wanted to get this mess of refunding the money  then wait for another deal etc etc then finally i decided to go to xolo service center and they reinstalled the os and device started working few days ago i observed another point while there is any car horn major noice then there is disturbance in the call voice filckers  somwhere its my gut feeling that such kind of deals comes with defective materials and customer gets screwed up  i am really disappointed and highly dissatisifed with this deal ideally there shouldnt have any single star howeveri rate  for the price part  dont know if somebody would react in this matter however i completed my social responsibilty thanks amazon regards yash

8570	Karbonn Duple A1+ (Black)	i bought this phone out of necessity and am literally ruing my decision it always says that memory is low i had to reduce the number of apps from 6 to just 1  ie whatsapp and it still hangs the first line of my keyboard is malfunctioning the charging slot had to be replaced  twice and that too from an outsider since the service center said that it would take me over a week to get it analysed and repaired i bought this phone from a retailer on 28th september 2013 and i have experienced all this in not even 4 months since i purchased it and i have to take out some more torturous months before i buy a new one

8575	Lava Iris 405 Plus (White)	its a budget phone specs aint something to write home about what i dont understand is why would anyone pay 45k for lava iris 405 when one can get lenovo a369i for 36k this really baffles me lenovo is a much reputed brand and a369i has the same specs as iris 405 well whoever is buying please take a moment and think about it

8586	BLACKBERRY 8830 World Edition Unlocked GSM PHONE - BRAND NEW BLACK	excellent
8587	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	at this price this is best smartphone you can buy this would be a good choice for you if you are not an app freak and wont waste time in playing games  pros  the best email client  best integration with facebook  fresh ui  compact size  front camera  microsoft office bundle is awesome  cons  sound system is not that great  limited app availability  no separate control over sound if you increase the volume of music that will apply to ringer as well
8588	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	i bought this phone 2 weeks ago and so far it has been a very pleasant experience the plastic is surprisingly sturdy though the screen does shift slightly in the back cover the screen looks brilliant and the blacks are the blackest in the sub20k range the android phones either have terrible constructions andor lowend internal specs this doesnt seem to be the case with windows phone as it works flawlessly even on midrange specs with hardly any stutters or loading times the camera is what you would expect from a budget phone though nokias strong suite of photography apps more than make up for the lack of quality i would recommend this to anyone who wants a reliable fast good looking budget phone
8589	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	being an android fan it was a tough decision to go for windows phone wanted it for my sister except the less option for quality apps its good if you have limited uses  pros completely offline voice guided maps 1010 6 month unlimited music downloads 1010 no more piracy decent camera and flash 810 better audio quality and loudness among phones in this range 910 great quality display 810 awesome touch experience smooth and fluid no occasional lags unlike other androids in this range ambient light sensor its worth mentioning its fastadjusts automatically finally you can transfer files using bluetooth  cons no fm very disappointing hangs occasionallyyou need to remove the battery to restart again very less option in terms of appsnot a single version of angry bird is freely available
8590	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	i bought this phone a month ago i thought to write a review after a week using this device later i thought it would be too early to write a review hence writing this review after 1 month of usage im writing this review after black update  this is a super cool and compact device people who are against bulky phones this is the best choice  trust me guys you wont regret  pros  1 device is super compact  2 windows phone with integrated social networking unlike android  3 email syncing is so crisp and fast  4 inbuilt adobe reader and full version of ms office  5 premium built device it doesnt look cheap infact its build quality is so strong  6 ips display and sunlight readability feature you wont find trouble reading this device in sunlight  7 my favorite xbox you can sync your xbox profile with your device and game console moreover there are many hd games available for a price  cons  1 battery drains in a days use  2 whats app loads little bit slow anyways you will get over it
8591	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	this product is with me from the last 2 years and i have a enjoyed  each and every second working with it great displayamazing camera quality and true 1gb ram packed 38 inch windows smartphone lack some apps in store but it is manageable seeing the alternatives it offers overall go for this it is better than recent and upcoming lumia models due to its simplicity and hard core graphic display it has thank you
8592	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	since i am handling this handset for the past one week and i felt satisfied with my investment for this product  a smartphone with windows apps is very user friendly and the performance of this device is fantastic for this budget but the people those who all are looking for games like android handsets this will disappoint them  over all its a fabulous handset under this budget price
8593	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	own this mobile bought it from the store a year back for the first 10 months i dint face any problem i was hassle free but lately there are lot of issues like phone getting stuck restarting and then power not working and space issues although there is 1 gb of space left
8594	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	hey guys really nokia lumia 620 is awesomei am using this phone for past one month and its awesomeyou cant compare this phone with android phonesreally windows phones are professional by nature which android kiddoos cant understand
8595	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	as much i heard and read the reviews of this phone is below then all the expectation and have some defects in its speaker
8596	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	given the damage piece and doesnt replace that  i didnt expected like this from amazon customer service also very poor
8597	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	guys this is an awsm phonemiddl range phone from nokia lumia familyu will never get any good phone with lot of qualities like this 1nfc 2front cam 35mp primary cam 4isp bright screen 51 ghz dual core processr 6adreno 305 graphicsgames r awsm 7512 ram
8598	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	nokia lumia is best phone in range of 15k n love to oparate windows in phone but a little problm with uploading pic and video
8599	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	phone is good reached on time packaging and all other things were proper best deal i ever had keep it up
8600	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	amazon india has done it quick  very nicely packed and great courier service  this is the only website bringing in the american efficiency and service to india keep it up be slightly more competitive in pricing avninder mutchall
8601	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	nokia lumia 620 is a very fast mobile  it is little bit difficult for beginners but after a couple of days it will be smooth  there are not much apps in windows but they are scrutinized and checked  this ensures that the apps does not take more space or battery  the screen is smaller than the nokia lumia 520 but the images are sharp and the ppi dense  anything can be read under sunlight because of black colour glass  the best thing about the camera is its flash  the touch sensitivity is good and can be used even when we wear gloves  sound quality is good  however the ram is a bit low 512 mb  overall this phone is better than its counterparts sony xperia j  i recommend this phone for people with an average budget and needs most of the facilities of a computer
8602	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	the phone is great though i have used it for only over a month here is my view  pros 1 good looks responsive screen and software 2 number of apps are enough for me dont know about app junkies 3 great ui trumps android  4 awesome map guide great by any standards  cons 1 pics in low light are decent nothing to boast about zoom is not that great grainy pics after 2x zoom 2 battery life is around 12 hours with intense usage 18 with normal and 22 with casual usage 1300 mah is not enough atleast 1500 is necessary  but hey for a phone at 12k this phone is loaded with features and has a great feel to it looks elegant and classy a must buy at this budget
8603	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	very good phone in this segment with decent camera suggested for a moderate user nokia music is the best thing
8604	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	windows phone sucks
8605	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	awesome phone 
8606	Nokia Lumia 620 (Black)	good
8607	BlackBerry Q10 (Pure White)	i ordered a z10 sometime ago through amazon and i had a great time with it blackberry is is really amazing and fast however it he speaker concked off within 10 days and amazons 10 day return policy helped me to return the item i was really impressed with blackberry that i decided to get another blackberry and ordered q10 note that this is my first time into blackberry the screen size is not that small but it is smaller to all the large size screens out there but its useful if you are not into multi media its great for emails browsing facebook etc the keypad is nice and comfortable the battery lasts for 2 days which is something not available in todays smart phones overall a great product and a good buy
8608	BlackBerry Q10 (Pure White)	q10 has great specs for a bb device the screen size is very small comparing to the giant phones we see in the market today for cheaper prices but it is a quality screen with good ppi the screen is easy to read even under direct sunlight  q10 has a 15ghz dualcore snapdragon s4 plus processor and 2gb of ram under the hood which is more than enough for the apps you run on it  one of the main features it has is the keyboardwhich bb lovers would love touch keyboard users would find it bad thoughfor not having features like swype   bbq10 comes with bb10 operating systemwhich is navigated using the touchscreen and gestures it is a great upgrade from the old operating systembut the app ecosystem lags miles behind android and iphoneyou can port android apps to the q10 though they don8217t all work properly  camera  it8217s just not on the same level with pictures we shoot with the galaxy s48217s 13megapixel camera the htc one8217s 4ultrapixel camera or even the camera on the iphone 5  who is this phone for this phone is strictly for die hard blackberry fans  this phone is expensiveif you are a bb fan and you are buying this phone for just bbmthen you have better options for the price you can get an iphone or an android and install bbm bbm beta on android now supports voice calling too if you are an android useror an iphone user wanting to buy this you better dont this is not a product for you and you are gonna hate it for not finding the apps you use on others not available on bb
8609	BlackBerry Q10 (Pure White)	this blackberry phone is not really a good option to buy has many flaws in it the screen get damaged easily and can break even your phone slips out of hand software lacks many features and also misses lots of common and important apps in its app store so for me this model is no no

8619	Sony Xperia E1 (Single SIM, White)	xperia e1 is a successor to sonys xperia e released in 2013 the e1 has better specs and better performance than the old oneand is one of the best branded budget device coming under rs10000  performance  even though this only has a dual core processor and 512mb ramthe performance of the device is excellent many games like temple runriptide gp2dead trigger etc ran without much issues thanks to adreno 302 gpu on board  some notable features and issues 1 a dedicated walkman key on the top 2 camera is just a basic 3mp auto focus one with no led flashonly wvga30fps video is supported there is no front camoverall disappointed 3 the build quality of the phone is excellentdoesnt look cheap at allthe back cover has a matte finish which gives it a nice grip to hold the phone 4 apps cannot be moved to sdcard which means you are left with 2gb of storage for apps 5 viewing angles are oknot that good the brightness fades when playing tilting games like riptide gp2 6 android 43 jellybeanand 44 kitkat update is expected 7 only 512 mb ram 8 on screen homebackmultitasking buttons 9 phone is thicker than many other budget devices 10 liion 1750 mah battery  if you are a heavy internet usernot enough to get you through one full day  benchmarks nenamark score  56fps  impressive antutu benchmark  12900  quadcore devices like xolo q700q700i scores the same quadrant  5680  in the box  usb chargercablenormal headphones  overall a good branded budget device far better than those budget devices offered by samsungboth in terms of performance and build quality howeveryou can get better 1gbquadcore devices from indian manufactures like micromaxxolo etc at this price range if brand doesnt matter to youi would suggest you to get those  note  if you buy it from a sony dealeryou can get a free headset sony mdrzx110a worth rs 1390 im not sure whether this deal is available online as it is not mentioned anywhere
8620	Sony Xperia E1 (Single SIM, White)	one cannot expect much from a budget device but when compared to moto e i would rather say it slightly slides down a bit the camera quality is not good ram is certainly not enough as the phone hangs quite a bit  if you listen to a song and simultaneously browse in chrome app  as chrome occupies lot of ram  its better than other devices at this price range except for moto e overall its a good phone and i would not regret buying it  pros  dual core processor  adreno 302  100db speaker  nice interface cons  less ram hangs quite a bit  poor camera quality no android kitkat
8621	Sony Xperia E1 (Single SIM, White)	bought this phone a month earlier out of confusion the reason was that the reviews dont speak highly of it some of the issues of my concern were 1 cant move apps to sd card 2less ram of 512 mb only 3 slow processor  how i overcame of these  1updated the operating system to android kitkat 44 now i can easily move important appsgames etc to sd card  2 a 512 mb ram is not less by any means if it appears insufficient make a habit of force closing  the apps while not in use  3 the slowness of the system appears when the ram doesnt have free space try the above trick to sort it out  look u cant expect to get a sony xperia z at rs 614900 i bought it at rs 5990 what u can get a phone better at the same price trust me this is the best piece at this value
8622	Sony Xperia E1 (Single SIM, White)	wonderful piece at this price the touch is buttery smooth and no lagging whatsoever when compared to other phones of this range didnt face any problem till now while playing games the best thing is the sound and image clarity this is a gem for music lovers and theres a separate outside button also for listening songs you can listen to a different song each time just by shaking the phone there are lot many features to tell about you can see them in the phone description and i didnt find any drawbacks in any of them moreover its the sony brand which makes you trust it and theres one year warranty as well from them simply love it
8623	Sony Xperia E1 (Single SIM, White)	its quite a good phone for its price the 3 mp camera is good and takes pretty clear pictures even in low light the apps run smoothly and the speaker works fine too but sadly the apps directly downloaded or pictures or videos that are taken from the camera goes into the internal memory and cannot be moved to the sd card it has a dedicated music player but id have liked the ear phone volume to be a bit more loud as it does not have an inear cord the ambient noises disrupt the music overall it works well and good if you have a restricted budget this might be a great catch
8624	Sony Xperia E1 (Single SIM, White)	its really sad to say that sony is selling such a phone without any reason it hangs and that to me is a big problem i work for the media and bad publicity is always bad for any brand it is better to withdraw such products and replace them with better quality products and charge extra rather than say its a smart phone for such a less price overall its a bad offering coming from such a huge name sony
8625	Sony Xperia E1 (Single SIM, White)	good phone the camera is not at all good but the design is outstanding battery life is good but after upgrading to 442 kitkat facebook has got installed this is the only drawback which i have noticed till date amazon did a good job by delivering the item within 2 days but the packaging was not at all good

8669	LG G2 (White, 32GB)	hello all  i ordered this product on 5th of april and got in my hands on 8th of april as soon as i turned it on i received the kit kat update i am experiencing a strange problem with my head phones some wired noise is coming from the left side ear buds when i hear any video  music  speech when i checked in google i came to know that many users of lg g2 users are experiencing this problem and they all started to experience this after their kitkat upgrade  when i contacted lg helpdesk they were not aware of this issue and they asked to hear music in safe mode i ended up with the same result in safe mode too when i contacted the helpdesk again they asked me to visit yhe service center  will update more once i visit the service center
8670	LG G2 (White, 32GB)	wow what a phone my budget was 50k after a long search in net i found this phone wch price was less and also lot of user reviews were good by seeing all those review i bought this phone  phone look was excellent the rear keys was great to use the camera clarity was better but still camera was taking much time to focus clarity was good in mid light also i loved the 3d panorama option  i was experiencing the actual android experience the knock on feature was simply awessome audiozoom video zoom and new features wch was really utilizable features  i use samsung galaxy note but compared to samsung in all way this phone is best  cons  the only problem wch i struggled in this phone is whenever i speak in phone i got a screeching sound wch was irritating i speak in phone atleast 5hours in a day so i felt this is a major issue wch i hav to take step  so i returned the phone thanks for amazon i got my money back on the same day i returned
8671	LG G2 (White, 32GB)	first of all  im an android developerlast few months before buy lgg2  i was looking for a high configuration android device my fist choice was nexus 5  then i accidentally noticed lg g2 i loved the design of this phonewhen i was decided to buy nexus 5 my problem was it does not have an efficient battery backupbut lg g2 was awesome superb battery backup  i mean it will work over 24 hour even 24 hour internet on playing high graphics gamesetcits camera in superb when i compared with sonyz1 and g2 fits in my hands even it have 52 ips fullhd display display is incredibly amazing in some reviews i heard that it have heating issue on gamingbut no there is not that much notifiable heat issue this phone is really quick and secured  very easy to use like iphone devices i brought the black 4g version of this  and now it is my business phone the difference between black and white lgg2 is  in black version when we run a black theme image videogameetc we feel like the entire top is displayin white everybody notice the phone and ask about itwhite is for show off  however im waiting for next lg g3

8673	LG G2 (White, 32GB)	i expected lg g2 to have an excellent camera and above average sound quality through earphones it turns out that camera is not that great as everyone says coming from galaxy s4 this is not par with g4 but sound quality is great through my sennheiser cx 275s also using lgs music app battery and screen are excellent i had to replace the headphone on the first day since one side of it was not working i think this is common for many people trying to get over with the camera let down fact other than that i love it
8674	LG G2 (White, 32GB)	excellent phone  lg should do some innovative marketing to sell their products  their products are any time better than samsung one area where the phone could have been better would be the outer case  the plastic is not that strong and tends to deform easily at the edges if the phone falls on its edge otherwise  an excellent gadget with a humongous battery life great camera and display clarity  and feather sensitive touch
8675	LG G2 (White, 32GB)	in one da delivery using this phone for past 20 days i would say this phone is super fast never seen a android phone with this performance battery backup is excellent even g3 is not fast compared to g2 only problem it dont have pop up notification alert like s4 or nexus 5 will have to unlock to see all messages and all mails

8688	LG G2 (White, 32GB)	lg g2 is one of the best android phones you can buy today lg has lately started to produce quality devices and google has chosen none other than lg to push out their nexus 4 and nexus 5 devices  features 52inch 1920 x 1080 display 424 ppi  qualcomm msm8974 snapdragon 800 with a 226ghz quadcore krait 400  same as in nexus 5  2 gb ram 16gb and 32gb variants 13 mp camera 3000mah lipo battery  pros great 1080p display with a high pixel per inch density 441  great camera with optical stabilization to counter camera shakes this gives you blur free images and better low light performance image quality is not up to that level of htc oneor some high end lumia devicesbut the quality is still greatg2s hdr mode works well  1080p 60 fps video capture is supported and the quality of the video is good there are some focusing issues though  this device is a power house which means high end games and apps can be run without any lags adreno 330 graphics processor makes things really smooth  good battery backup  3000mah battery may not be that big considering the huge display it has to power up still the battery backup is very solid  it has volume and power buttons on the back cover for easier access  this can be considered as a con depending on your preference though   cons design is not that attractive no sdcard slot lgs custom ui on top of android jellybean is a mixed bagsome prefer stock android experience over custom ones  this will get android kitkat update for surebut how long will it take remains to be seen  benchmarks quadrant  19000 antutu  32000  overall a good flagship phone from lg with high end specs competing directly with samsung galaxy s4 and htc one  lgs own nexus 5 comes with almost the same specs but runs stock kitkat android and is priced a few thousands lesser
8689	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	ive had this phone for almost 5 months nowand i am very impressed i dont know what happened to the phone of the other reviewer herebut mine has been 100 waterproof so far   also i am a person whos been using android phones from one of the very first galaxy phones the samsung galaxy spica ive had 23 more galaxies and what ive noticed is that they alwaysalways slow down within 6 months of purchase the lag is first noticeable then becomes irritating and then downright annoying  no such hassles so far with xperia buttery smooth till nowno lagno crashes its almost like my ipad yesits that good  waterproofing im a doctorand have to put surgical gloves for various procedures which leaves a thin film of white dust on my handsi invariably have to answer a few calls in between my procedures and the phone gets all dusty once im done with my proceduresi simply wash the phone under the tap along with my hands no issues for the past 2 monthstill now i was scared to do thatbut now i do it regularly  camerafantastic i have a nikon d3100 slr while the pictures from the xperia are not dslr quality its 13mp is good enuf to take pics in daylight so good that its very comparable to the same snaps taken on the slr low light quality is not so hotbut better than any camera phone ive used so far except the nokia carl zeiss ones and the best part is that it has a dedicated camera buttonit is sooooooo useful  battery these days any high end phone is expected to last a daythats it this xperia lasts around 30 hours with moderate useive streched it to 50 hrs on stamina mode once  so heres the bottom line  what i liked all of the above plus removable battery unlike the other waterproof xperias 47 inch display is just right not a monsternot a midget top end specs 15ghz quad core krait series processor2nd fastest processor in the world after the newly launched snapdragon 800 series adreno320 graphics  2gb ram 13mp cam  what i didnt only 8gb internal storageso a big sd card is a must i use 16gbwhich i find adequate vga front campatheticesp when u compare the beautiful 131mp back cam bezels are too bigin fact all the dimensions could be slimmed down a bit slipperyhave dropped it 45 times already  what i dont mindnot deal breakers not full hd screencant really tell the difference on a 47 inch screen and in fact it has the same pixel density as the iphone retina display which is enuf for me not gorilla glass and can scratch easilybut this problem is easily remedied by a good screen protector lots of sony softwarebloatwarebut doesnt bother me coz phone hasnt slowed one bitand some of them are actually useful    so hope this review helps i bought mine from a shop in kerala for 28k i felt then and still feel that its worth every paisa
8690	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	i have been using this phone for the last 15 yrs now and it has proved to be very reliable some highlights 1 great photos and videos with the 13 mp rear camera esp at short range 2 am planning to extend memory with a sd card in future however have been able to store 200 photos in the internal memory itself better to clear thumbnails and undesirable videosphotos installed by default on the phone 3 have upgraded from jelly bean to kitkat to lollipop  os updates are very prompt 4 runs 100 apps incl rss reader about a doz business and news apps organizer yahoo gmail and windows live each with multiple accounts broking and banking apps about 67 games for the kids toolkits avast comprehensive pack a few social networking apps  smoothly 5 battery lasts for about 1 day i charge it for about 2 hrs late evening to reach full charge 6 works as a satnav device on long journeys smoothly on 2g3g 7 battery performance deteriorates only when the phone is exposed to heated environments like when left inside a car even if not directly exposed to sunlight or if too many simultaneous apps are running with very few actually in use with lollipop it is possible to terminate all unnecessary apps with 1click 8 some apps like cm security and battery boost actually end up slowing the phone and giving false updates that 100s of mb space has been cleared every now and then etc  in reality this app simply markets dozens of other apps some not even supported on google play all the time 9 today as i check prices this phone which was launched a little earlier than the z1 has held its value quite well and is available at a max 1014 discount whereas the xperia zz1 which was launched as a topof the line phone is available at 4555 discount though it features better specs i am now on the lookout for another good midrange phone for my spouse and that is getting to be a challenge 
8691	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	i had bought sony xperia zr in august13 i have been using the phone for over 1 year 6 months the phone is working pretty and has good features and also good for music lovers overall phone is quite good  but recently my phone fell down from pocket and the screen cracked the touch sensation didnt work all other functions of phone were working the phone was receiving calls and sms but couldnt respond as touch screen was not working  having approached sony authorized service centers they informed me that sony doesnt change the touch screen of this model they further proposed me a ridiculous deal wherein i have to pay 80 of phone value and buy a new phone or else i have to pay 50 value and get refurbished piece  why does sony manufacture a phone which cannot be technically repaired by them  and what is the logic in paying 80 of value when all the other functions apart from screen are ok  does the phone processor ram motherboard other inbuilt software have no value  also from where do they get refurbished models  they get refurbished models by cheating guys like me on pretext of 80 deals they get the old phone from person like me refurbish and give to someone else as refurbished piece and moreover  sony customer care team did not respond properly this issue  this is absolute unprofessional and unethical  i had feeling that sony being a japanese company would never cheat but all the mobile manufacturers are same be it sony samsung etc once your phone is damaged they inevitably make you spend like hell or you are forced to buy a new phone  please dont ever buy this phone or any of sony xperia range once it is damaged it may never get repaired  moreover the sony xperia range is known for cracks in screen you can google for proof across the world ppl have experienced it  please refrain from buying this phone and also take care before purchsing costly phones
8692	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	xperia zr is simply awesome  in this range it is best phone waiting for andriod 44 update i have loaded 105 appsincluding games and still performance is superb
8693	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	using it from almost 1 year damn damn good performance camera amazing display astonishing and looks very cool  attractive worth purchasing  only one issuenot at all good for selfie lovers due to front camera only 3mp but this is something a guy can manage i know girls cant   overall i am in love with this phone
8694	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	i did struggle a lot while deciding the one from the followings  lg optimus gpro e988 32k  lg nexus 4 2527k  htc one x 25k  xperia z1 42k  but eventually i went ahead with xperia zr it is as good as nexus 4  but nexus 4 is gradually getting phased out  other choices were bit more expensive this does have a relatively lesser clocked processor but this seems to be having just enough to serve my need  ability to multitask without much lag  call quality is good  but volume is below per i struggled under noisy background  emails  calendar work nice  but with 3gwifi running all day with skype  whatsapp battery drains out by a day  camera wasnt my focus neither was videomusic but they work real nice camera does good under both low  normal lights videos play well please note this has a lesser resolution than z1 but screen also is tad smaller  so eventually you really get a smart display  but with so many new updates coming from sony mostly os updates  the battery performance has really become a pain it drains out within 56 hours of standard usage also this phone has a manufacturing problem with its blue tooth it works  then all of a sudden  it stops no answer from sony overheating is another area  you will notice it is getting heated up quite frequently i had to restart to keep things under control same problem with mobile reception it shows all bars  but it doesnt make calls no data flow you need to restart to get it back alive  conclusion average buy if you wish to spend little more you may give s4  htc one preference or go for next gen nexus perhaps i am quite disappointed with this purchase now and will not recommend
8695	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	the camera quality and the processing speed are great  heating issue is a slight bother during charging and continuous gaming
8696	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	this is a slightly more expensive model in this series but has several merits i have always been a fan of the xperia series it is one of the most successful series by sonly also formerly or sony errickson and over the years i have used a number of models from this series  actually i came across this series a few years ago when i was looking for a phone with the following characteristics  1 very compact 2 easy to use 3 superb camera quality 4 reasonable price  i found that the experia series met all the above requirements  this model from the series maintains all the above features but at the same time it has improved upon all the features and specifications those who have used the earlier models will be pleased at the vast improvements those for whom this is the firsttime buy of a machine from this series it will surely give a pleasant surprise  the increased cost is ok when one considers the enhancements one finds in this model
8697	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	i recommend sony xperia zr c5502  for those who wish to purchase a mobile which is not too expensive but which is equally useful with all useful functions the audio quality and display are awesome worth the price
8698	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	i had bought sony xperia zr in july13 i have been using the phone for over 1 year the phone is working pretty and has good features overall phone is quite good  but recently my phone fell down from pocket and the screen cracked the touch sensation didnt work all other functions of phone were working the phone was receiving calls and sms but couldnt respond as touch screen was not working  having approached sony authorized service center they informed me that sony doesnt change the touch screen of this model they further proposed me a ridiculous deal wherein i have to pay 80 of phone value and buy a new phone or else i have to pay 50 value and get refurbished piece  why does sony manufacture a phone which cannot be technically repaired by them  and what is the logic in paying 80 of value when all the other functions apart from screen are ok  does the phone processor ram motherboard other inbuilt software have no value  also from where do they get refurbished models  they get refurbished models by cheating guys like me on pretext of 80 deals they get the old phone from person like me refurbish and give to someone else as refurbished piece  this is absolute unprofessional and unethical  i had feeling that sony being a japanese company would never cheat but all the mobile manufacturers are same be it sony samsung etc once your phone is damaged they inevitably make you spend like hell or you are forced to buy a new phone  please dont ever buy this phone or any of sony xperia range once it is damaged it may never get repaired  moreover the sony xperia range is known for cracks in screen you can google for proof across the world ppl have experienced it  please refrain from buying this phone
8699	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	still the best phone with this price range
8700	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	been using the product for more than three months received the item in expected condition the product works well and i have no complaints the said delivery time is very conservative but i got the phone in two working days and to add i saved money as the seller had a difference of about 2300 when compared to others  highly recommended
8701	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (Black)	my xperia zr got problems while in the rainon the second day of purchase  its not water proof i have my phone spoilt and sony customer support says that the warranty will not be honored if water gets inside try talking to the sony support centre and check before buying  dont get fooled by the advertisements i bought my phone from croma and let me tell you they will not respond to you properly even the next day or on the phone it took me 20 minutes to get the croma guy to get a complaint number  basically you are stuck with a 30k phone i dont know what will happen to mine xperia zr sucks and so does croma for giving me a defective phone
8702	Karbonn Smart A92 (Black-Silver)	its a very good product fulfill my all expectations this is very smart by karbonn in my range nice product
8703	Karbonn Smart A92 (Black-Silver)	i think this a good smart mobile phone in this price and by specification the best price on the amazon
8704	Karbonn Smart A92 (Black-Silver)	not a reliable one few months into the purchase it started turning off on its own visited service centre couple of times already but the problem is still repeating wont advise to buy
8705	Karbonn Smart A92 (Black-Silver)	good price
8706	Karbonn Smart A92 (Black-Silver)	this phone did not work for even a single day it keeps on switching off often say every hour it is in service center since then
8707	Karbonn Smart A92 (Black-Silver)	excellent 
8708	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	absolutely brilliant phone for the money for people who are ignoring it just because its made by lg kindly note that google selected this brand to make flagship and authorized android devices ie the nexus series  lg has put in their best in this phone first the 5234 1080p bezel less display is absolutely gorgeous to look at pictures and videos are a delight to watch on this one text is so crisp it leaves no margin to ask for more  besides being a snapdragon 800 device it provides the best battery backup among its class i can easily extract 2024 hours of usage with 5 hours screen on time thats remarkable for such a powerful device with a power hungry 1080p display as rated by gsmarena the talktime offered by g2 on 3g network is just above 25 hours and an endurance rating of 81 hours  talking about the camera its a 13mp shooter with auto focus and optical image stabilization only phone to have ois in its class besides nexus 5 daylight pictures are great and full of details and low light images are not bad either the camera takes a little more time than others to focus but its ok it shoots 1080p 60fps video as well after applying a camera mod you can also shoot 4k 30fps and 120fps 720p slow motion video  this phone features the best screen to surface ratio and while using it for the first time it feels like holding a big screen with nil bezels the internal storage is not expandable via microsd card but you can always use an otg cable to attach usb drives im using a 32gb otg pen drive and it works great  the ui has some nifty customization options and doesnt overload the system with bloat like samsungs touch whiz one of my fav is the qslide quickmemo and the cliptray with qslide you can start minimized apps with resizable windows and can also change their opacity while working in the background when required quickmemo is a memo app where you can save notes in a second  being a snapdragon 800 device it runs the most intense apps with ease g2 has topped most of the benchmarks as reported by gsmarena  till now i had no trouble and this phone delights me everyday with its capabilities excellent service as usual by amazon one of the most trusted site i placed the order at night and received the message in a few hours that the product has been shipped received it in 2 working days properly padded with bubble wrap and completely sealed extremely satisfied
8709	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	i dont understand why lg is not famous in india this phone doesnt require a review i will just clear the confusion for people choosing between nexus 5 and lg g2 here are few points of consideration  the back buttons are designed with some intelligence they are not any drawbacks rather some smart thinking  the knock on feature is great which is not present in any other phone you need to knock your phone to unlock it which makes it a button free phone   3000 mah battery is crazy i sometimes have to find my lost charger wont discharge  the customized user interface ui by lg gives your phone a fresh look otherwise every android phone looks same you can also download themes fonts wallpapers etc which are offered by lg only keep changing the looks  no need to swipe to pick a call just put your phone on your ear and your phone will do the rest  multiple apps can be used simultaneously by swiping through the apps like in ipad   camera is decent sound is lound and crisp touch sensitivity is wow processor is too damn fast doesnt hang or lag for even a second uncommon and district phone graphics are great  go for it
8710	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	i am also a verified buyer i bought the factory unlocked att 32gb  pros excellent  smooth touch excellent call quality excellent display excellent screen to body size easy to hold with one hand excellent battery you wont believe it if i say how fast charging slow discharging advice please dont use unwanted battery savers ram cleaners etc its all built in kitkat 442 lollipop coming within 2 months excellent music player quality excellent speakers optimus os is good excellent camera  cons nothing at all  i recommend this to all
8711	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	this is an amazing product from lg initially i was a bit skeptical on spending this amount for lg phone but then evaluated the product by actually visiting one of the electronic retail chains the camera and display are excellent and overall experience of phone is equally good the consignment was delivered 2 days prior to the committed time this created the wow factor i am not a great fan of online shopping but amazon has changed the way i think thanks
8712	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	firstly don8217t go by manufacturer or brand im writing this review after 4 months of purchase hope this will be helpful  i was thinking to go for better smartphone in the market as i was fed up with other branded smart phones i used especially battery life and began looking for and saw a couple of reviews among all lg g2 is my first and foremost android smartphone even today i have been using this phone for more than 4 months now  it is worth buying phone though price is comparatively high i would suggest rather than buying a mobile for one year go for this and you can use this for next a couple of years lg has done an excellent job with g2 and its remarkably comfortable to hold the phones rounded edges and gently tapered back and never feels overly large when youre making a phone call  cool features long battery life android v422 os and can be upgraded to kitkat version 226 ghz qualcomm quad core processor 21 mp secondary camera 52inch capacitive touchscreen 13 mp primary camera full hd recording optimum screen utilization quick remote feature quick slide feature amazon gabbar deals delivered as they promised  what i did not like headphone is not that good micro sd card but you can opt 32 gb variant
8713	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	display  absolutely wonderful i used to have samsung galaxy but the display on this has perfect color saturation and contrast speed  too fast for me dont need more than this  battery  ive been using this for two weeks and the battery with songs video and some gaming has lasted me more than 18 hrs which is great  lg overlay on android  it is nowhere as bad as samsung lg has certainly struck a balance between customization of android and pure android i like it a lot  buttons  no side buttons and im really happy with that i had a look at sony xperia and it was ridiculous to see how many buttons i would have deal with this has 3 buttons 1 power 2 volume and you cant mess up while using it  headset  the headset speakers are really good quality they are not great quality but really good quality extremely comfortable and aesthetically look really nice  camera  ive not used camera much but the pictures are really good great contrast and sharpness its not very quicki usually use a dslr but still manages to take good pictures  now the bad part  the mic in the headset provided by lg is really bad it picks up all kinds of noise from surrounding and person on the other side of the line just cant hear you speak moreover lg has not provided with a clip with the headset so the cable keeps swinging around and your volume keeps going up and down with the swinging when you are speaking to somebody
8714	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	first of all i would like to appreciate amzon for its amazing pricing and service the phone is awesome  best display  no lag was encountered by me during my use i am intense gammer the battery is outstanding even better than my previous phone lumia 520 it easily last whole day with my heavy usage the applications loads fast due to snapdragon 800 chipset just one problem you may face is lack of accessories available for this phone atleast in my area if you want to buy this phone dont think twice before buying it  also it has promised android l update 
8715	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	excellent phone with great features the highlights of this phone are display no lags and battery waiting for lollipop update amazon delivered too late to my address than the estimated time and need to improve the delivery system
8716	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	coming from s4 this is wondeful set lg did not gain its worth of share in market but in india when reliance mobile came in 2002 only lg sets survived for more than 35 years even google gave its nexus to lg i was sckeptical for getting lg product stereotype of indian market  but was fed up of samsung  last 5 phones and just wanted to get rid of samsung loved lumia 1520 for camera  size and fluidity of windows22but dropped the idea because of limited market and sudden pulling out of whatsapp this week only for no reason  and not declared when whatsapp will be back so my choice was between z1 and g2 both same battery phones but i checked so many reviews and after extensive research i okayed with g2  and believe me 60 monster it is i started out with 65  batter 2 pm today out of box downloaded 12 gb of wifi data most of the screen on multi tasking with facebook whatsapp gmail gamesyes batman  asphalt 8 runs so smooth you have to see it in action at 11 pm i was left with 10  battreynow this is monster both in terms of speed fluidity responsivenes do not hang even once  s4 would have hung so many times and wanted restart after factory format and batter  huge applause just full pf praises for this beastsamsung  never coming back to you
8717	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	awesoooommeeee this phone is jus too gud  if u r blind about the brand name i enjoyed nd still enjoying each and every thing about the phonebattery of the g2 is jus out f this worldi ve no words its very light nd powerful nd yea reasonably priced too jus go for t u ll never regret

8720	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	superb product at this price amazon rules  i get the cheap rates compare to other online portal websites  thanks amazon
8721	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	good deal by gabbardeals and good delivery by amazon  using this phone from 2 days and its really worth every money spent on this phones  the features are well customized in 422 though upgrade may be needed after some time  cameratouch display battery performance is amazing but do not like headphones jack at bottom  simply made better choice over galaxy s4 i feel 
8722	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	terrific display slim form and looks very premium mustbuy for people looking to buy a flagship phone the phone is barely one day old as of nowbattery life has been somewhat okayish because i fully charged it at 1030 am and by 330 pm battery is down to 65i guess the battery should be given time to set inotherwise im very satisfied with the phone let it be the stunning screen or the premium feel dont listen to people who say built quality is avg its quite the opposite actually or the well detailed camera dont go for any other brand such as samsunghtcsonylg kicks all their butts and in styleall this coming from an iphone 4s user  update after 1 month use  the phone is an absolute joy to use battery life has improved and now it lasts for about 2023 hrs on average and on heavy days it lasts 14 hrs max on 3g data and play store downloads intermittently with moderate web browsingthe camera is a cracker and photos look simply stupendous and very addictive when paired with the snapseed photo editing app and hd movies look delightful esp when viewed in the dark the display is really classy with zero distortion when viewed from the sides and truetolife contrasts cons it does get somewhat warm while playing hd games but nothing uncomfortable without a case the phone does feel slippery to hold not exactly a con but it is a bit tiring to wait for the 44 kitkat update have been waiting with bated breath since the first time it was previewed for the g2 on youtube
8723	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	every thing in this handset is amazing ui is good display is also good good resolutiongood battery life overall above average phonetruly a value for money
8724	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	the product is fab best camera and features beat iphone lg keep it up bring more smartphones of this kind
8725	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	i bought this phone primarily because of its battery life and i was not disappointed at all its quick and does everything pretty well and yeah the battery is really good  the only negatives  headphoneheadset jack is at the bottom which is a bit inconvenient  there are very few stores selling lg accessories like cases if lg had to bundle the quickwindow caseto all owners just like samsung did it would have been great
8726	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	probably the best specced handset around right now at a price lower than most flagships its buttery smooth and battery lasts more than any phone ive used cant go wrong with the g2
8727	LG G2 (Black, 32GB)	all the technical specs and the feature seem to be performing as explained n listed gifted to my dad who likes the whole user experience is brilliant despite being used by a first time android user features like double tap no hard buttons on the sides automatic answer without touching the answer button are some which are greatly appreciated
8728	Xolo Q700S Plus (Gold)	i didnt buy this from amazon  the product is wonderfully made and the build is solid  i bought it from a local shop as a gift for my father the screen is just wonderful ans it surely looks bright  only con is the battery life with barely covers a day  rest all is fine with the phone
8729	Xolo Q700S Plus (Gold)	its awesome and the service from amazon is trustworthy
8730	Xolo Q700S Plus (Gold)	plzz specify the colour of the handset i have ordered it thrice but i m getting gold colour whereas i want silver colour so plzz mention the colour
8731	Xolo Q700S Plus (Gold)	i bought this 1 month ago from amazon phone is grt looking nice  thin but front camera is worst  and battery life is not so good and otg not supported  but overall it is nice budget phone
8732	LG G PRO-2 D838 (TITAN)	lg g pro 2 is a fantastic device the hardware is great though the processor is not the latest it is among the best snapdragon 800 3 gb ram makes lot of difference to the performance of the phone though you might find the ram being used to the maximum level the phones performance is just fantastic phones screen is bright and vivid viewing angles are good and the screen is highly visible under scorching sun lg has done well with its software os camera is good though not the best they have brought in multi window one hand operation multi tasking capabilities which looks very similar to note 3 features some may miss the stylus though the call quality is up to mark i did not find any issues with call quality though i sometimes felt that the wifi signal keeps dropping i have never felt this with my note 2 this is a minor observation and it has not hampered my usage anyways  pros 1 performance after using the phone for over a month i have never felt it slow down it takes everything you give it with ease its a monster 2 camera both front and back are good though not the best in class option to brighten selfies is a plus 3 value for money the phone is packed with features both hardware and software for the price this is one of the best if you do not want to go for one plus or the likes 4 lg flip cover i got a free lg flip cover magic window along with the phone i got a black phone and they shipped me a white flip cover initially i was skeptic to use it but after using it it just blew me away the cover is just fantastic and the phone has been customized to work with the magic window which is fabulous if you dont get a free one buy one yourself it is worth it  cons 1 this is not a flagship lg phone the g pro line is being discontinued by lg they are going to concentrate more on g series g2 g3 and g4 hence leading to speculation whether this will get the latest lollipop update no confirmation from lg as yet 2 users who move from samsung note series will badly miss the stylus this phone is a monster both in terms of size and performance an addition of stylus will make this invincible lg has sadly missed it  verdict if you are looking for a big phone with great performance go for this though some might be tempted towards one plus or the likes for the price
8733	LG G PRO-2 D838 (TITAN)	no lags or slowness 3 gb ram is too good very good battery beautiful screen good and loud speaker both camera very good  cons primary camera is a tad slow in focusingonce focused images are of excellent qualityabsence of physical button makes it bad to click photos easily
8734	LG G PRO-2 D838 (TITAN)	outstanding underrated phone by lg
8735	LG G PRO-2 D838 (TITAN)	best experience from amazon and the seller stallionsbut the earphone which i got is notvworking and from the battery side its close ti sbattery drains real fasti do have to plug to charger atleast 23 times a dayand this phone got a big problem with managing memory cardand nothing in the memory card can be controlled by any 3rd party applicationsbut i think this problem will vanish with the lolipop updateapart from that superb experience from gamingvideoaudiocameravideo sideif they fix the problems with mmc and battery lifethen this is the bestest phone in the  market
8736	LG G PRO-2 D838 (TITAN)	if you are reading this review and considering g pro 2 as one of your options then you are already in right track   i have been looking around for a long time very long time  i now understand all the terminology   this is the best in the market and titan color looks awesome   cameraoutstanding  audio mind blowing studio quality  screen omg this is a wonder   battery ok   if any one staying in and around hyderabad want to have a look at this phone mail me at tata9pmyahoocomi bet the moment you look at it you will buy it   note you may not find this in retail stores at this point of time  its unfortunate that lg is not promoting this product ofcourse this is good in a way that is why we are getting this for 30 k  last but not least dnt worry too much about 800 processor in this phone against 801 in the competitors dnt think there is any difference  amazon is awesome i opted for 1 days delivery which they did  the sellerstallions is bad gave me a white window case yeah it was free but it matters and it shows they dnt care for customers  instead of black one in spite of my emails  i kept it aside and looking for a black one in the market

8786	Lenovo Ideaphone A800 (Black)	its a laggy mobile no free ram struggles for free ram better to go for min 1 gb ram devices for android  screen is very good in size and battery is also very good but overall it doesnot perform as a multi tasking smartphone due to laggy performance not recommended
8787	Lenovo Ideaphone A800 (Black)	average performance but camera is superb with good focusing function head phone comes with it is worse   
8788	Lenovo Ideaphone A800 (Black)	one of the worst phone i had ever seenstart up is very slow app to home screen is very very slow reboots automatically in middle of work but overall look is good slim and lite no issues with the screen quality can view hd videos in same qualitydefault app installation path is internal memory not usb storage so the memory will degrade when new apps are installed cannot move some apps
8789	Lenovo Ideaphone A800 (Black)	nice phone but some difficult to operate not like samsung operation of course this may set right in course of time
8790	Lenovo Ideaphone A800 (Black)	screen resolution is not good memory capacity is poor fails to handle even the few apps installed on the phone
8791	Lenovo Ideaphone A800 (Black)	it is best value for money i got as it was described in offer i am satisfied fully thank you
8792	LG G3 (Silk White, 16GB)	this is the flagship phone from lg and is definitely a big upgrade from lg g2 the phone continues the buttonless designon the sides so that the buttons dont feel like bulges when phone is held in the hand while featuring a single button on back for basic functions the phone gives a very premium feel in hand and appears to be made of metal from a distance which it is not the bezels are ultra thin which may annoy some people because thin bezels make the phone more prone to breakage from the sidesthis was also seen in lg g2 but for people who can compromise on durability and ease of use it is great and you will find yourself staring at the screen every now and then battery life is good for a moderate user 1012 hrs but is horrible for a heavy user 4 hrs this is because the quad hd display and powerful processor drinks up a lot of juice and hence they need a powerful battery processor and ram appear to be very powerful on paper but actually there is still some lag while opening and closing some apps otherwise the phone runs smooth body color scheme is copied from iphone3 colors  pros 1 quad hd screen 2560 x 1440 538ppi one of the best 2 minimalistic design 3 powerful processor 4 3gb ramlol my pc has 15 gb 5 great camera  cons 1 overheating problem 2 slippery back 3 thin bezels look very beautiful but compromise on durability  and the last not exactly a con but buttons take some time to get used to
8793	LG G3 (Silk White, 16GB)	yeah it is a excellent device packing ok  does contain screen raplacement offer with quick circle case only problem is that it doesnt shows the last dialled nos
8794	LG G3 (Silk White, 16GB)	everything is perfect cant expect more except battery

8825	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	oppo this phone has got outstanding features particularly the camera and the touch pad at the back  i was surprised to see an oppo outlet here at madhapur  five star
8826	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	i think the phone is very good quality the beautiful screen is at par with sony and of course samsung hate amoleds have false colors it is little heavy but that is because of the great build quality which gives premium feel in my hand the color os which is based on android is probably the best i have ever used they provide regular updates and make it better every day the only cons is i am still waiting for 44 update which will also be available soonoverall great phone 
8827	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	oppo is a relatively new company in smartphone market and there is a chance you might have never heard about their devices as they have only recently launched in india oppo is the only company in the world who officially supports custom firmwares  like cyanogenmod  and post links to the roms in their official website  lets talk about the phone now   build quality and display n1 is a huge phoneand often times you will be compelled to use it with both hands as it packs a 1080p 59 inch display it is taller than the other phablets like samsung mega 63 and sony xperia ultra the built quality of the device is top notch and you wont feel this as a cheap chinese phone the screen is protected by gorilla glass 3 and has a ppi of 337 which is impressive the viewing angles are great and is a pleasure to watch pictures and videos on this big screen   camera this is the standout feature of this phone oppo is packing a 13mp f20 aperturedual led flash rotating camera forget about taking out of focus selfies with this you can rotate the camera on to the frontsee the image on the screen and click the best selfies possible the only other phone that offers such a rotating camera is gionee  elife mini e7  the performance of the camera is above average and most of the time it takes very good images with good color reproduction 8 seconds exposure support is therebut without a tripod forget taking a blur free image n1 also doesnt have image stabilization built in which you often see in many flagships   software oppo ships their phones with their custom build android version called color os which is actively developed by them and new features are added time to time oppo also supports close to stock cyanogenmod rom for this device which is optimized for performance the color os on n1 is based on android 42 jellybean and offers a lot of useful features and is easy to use for eg n1 supports offscreen gestures by which you can directly launch assigned apps when the screen is off for eg drawing a v on the screen will directly go into the torch app and a drawing a circle gets you the camera  since this is an open device and cm team officially supports this phone you can easily install the latest version of cyanogenmod kitkat 44x many other custom roms are also supported   otouch rear panel there is a small rectangle touch panel on the back of the device below the camera which allows you to scroll and launch apps it works well most of the time and is handy on such a big phonebut i dont think many would use this often you can swipe to navigate and double tab to launch apps   processorgpu and battery this is powered by a qualcomm snapdragon 600 quadcore 17 ghz krait 300 processor and adreno 320 gpu note that this is not the combination you see in many flagship devices out there like nexus 5 samsung s5 lg g2 etc this is the last generation chipsetbut the performance it offers is great and you would hardly notice any lag in your day to day usage adreno 320 gpu helps in good gaming performance n1 packs 2gb of ram which is more than enough to give a smooth multitasking experience  n1 packs a huge liion 3610 mah battery which is impressive and can easily take you through the day or even 2 days with moderate usage   things to note 1 there is no micro sdcard slot in here which means you are limited with around 16gb of internal storage of which around 12gb will be available for use however otg support is there which will allow you to plugin in pendrives via an otg cable 2 this is the color os version of the device if you are looking to install cyanogenmod or other roms visit oppo forums or xda for help 3 oclick bluetooth remote  this will help you to trigger camera shutter to take photosnot sure if you get this in the box  4 single sim  microsim  5 bluetooth 40 agps dlna and nfc are suported   verdict oppo n1 is a huge phoneheavier than many other flagships due its bigger battery inside and comes with some innovative features like the rotating camera if you are a selfie addict this is one of the best one you can get to take great selfies  competition  check recently announced xperia c3 which offers a wide angle front cam with soft flash  the main reason for me to own this device  apart from this rotating camera is the custom rom support oppo officially supports cyanogenmod romand oppo has provided free devices to other custom rom devs to make sure those roms too function very well on this device many flagships like nexus 5 or lg g2or oppos own find 7 takes better low light imagesso if selfie is not your thing i would recommend going for their latest flagships find7 or find7a which packs a lot more punch than n1 and is definitely one of the best devices in the market
8828	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	rotating camera broke within 2 months of usage
8829	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	its been more that a month i have been using oppo n1 its a great innovation from oppo awesome battery super camera quality no expandable memory color os is beautiful and we can flash cynogenmod binary too official oclick otouch features are called the real innovations and youre gonna love it powerful charger your phone gets charged very soon quality of earphone is above average gesture panel is what i use panel its of great use will be a wise choice for the people involved in a lot of gaming  i found some issues in transferring files using wifi direct  overall its a smartphone with real innovative features  battery is too good it is the best in the market i have used all the latest flagships of samsungnokiagioneehtcsony i work in a mobile rd center  but the battery is too good oppo provides regular updates for the os if you see a problem post it on the forum and if it is genuine you will recieve an update in 1520 days hdr mode in the camera is very effective and better than many out there regarding size  it is a phablet but you will get used to it soon now its been around 7 monthsa and i still can not get over it 
8830	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	very satisfied 
8831	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	i am oppo n1 1month used camera very good performance but extended memory no
8832	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	i have to hand it to oppo for making such a bold move to solve an increasingly common problem while most other manufacturers have stuck with the form factor theyre comfortable with oppos taken the extra effort to craft a highend swivel camera instead of just drilling an extra hole for a fixed secondary camera sure there are now many phones with satisfactory frontfacing cameras but the versatility of a swivel camera adds so much more fun to mobile photography i honestly never thought id end up taking so many group selfies using the n1 but the extra clarity and remote shutter make a difference here and of course oppos build quality plus software innovation here are just as reassuring  but the n1 seems to have rolled off the production line before the engineers could finish tuning the swivel camera on the bright side with the exception of the otouch trackpads awkward position theres nothing a software update cant fix here the camera just needs a faster shutter speed an improved hdr mode better white balance for red backgrounds and better video quality given oppos commitment to fixing bugs in the past we can safely recommend the n1 to anyone whos seeking the best smartphone for the highestquality selfies and android purists will also appreciate the bonus option to switch to cyanogenmod  the oppo n1 is a bold yet fun phone with the noble goal of solving the selfie problem unfortunately its camera is still a few updates away from perfection  pros swivel camera adds versatility officially supported on two roms great battery life  cons camera shutter speed isnt fast enough hdr mode is buggy backmounted trackpad is awkwardly placed

8834	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	unexpected performanceits dam cool each and everything is userfriendlycolor os is same as normal android 42
8835	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	worst phone
8836	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	again china dumping one chinese phone to indian ground already indian economic conditions are on sake this chinese brands are comes to ruin indian economy we are not trust on chinabrands ttheres is always quality  durability isse aafter sales sservice is also one of headaches
8837	OPPO N1 (White, 16GB)	they sure have a good rotating camera but not the worlds first as publicized  motorola has had this in their kitty almost 10 yrs back if you dont believe go look for motorola a925 dont do false advertising  i dont have anything against oppo but dont like false advertisement i actually like the n1 model but just a bit wary of the price
8838	LG Optimus L5 II E450 (Single SIM, Black)	optimus l5 ii e450 is budget android device from lg this was released in early 2013hence the specs are on the low side comparing to the specs we have today for the same price  features 1 single core 1 ghz cortexa9 mediatek mt6575 processor  other devices at this price range comes with quadcore processors 2 512 mb of ram only which is disappointing 3 battery backup is not goodwith a 1700 mah batteryyou can hardly get a full day of moderate use with internet on 4 android jellybean 41  outdatedthis is not even running android 42 5 average 5mp rear camera and no front facing camera for video calls  overall a good branded budget devicebut only suitable for basic apps use this cant handle gaming and graphic intense apps well you can get better performing devices like xolo q700xolo q1000 opus etc for this price today
8839	LG Optimus L5 II E450 (Single SIM, Black)	very good set
8840	LG Optimus L5 II E450 (Single SIM, Black)	i ordered it on saturday and got it at monday 9 am charged it for around 6 hours for first time using it with net connection all the day n no need to search for charger battery assures u completely one day 1700 mah best phone for money no hangs n lags loads all apps easily dnt hesitate jus go for it if u lov to use a single sim phone
8841	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	this is a great phone design is unique and awesome screen is amazing and performance  you should see it to believe it battery runs for more than 15 day with heavy usage  overall excellent phone  also this was my first purachase from amazonin and their service is extraordinary 
8842	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	it is said 34never judge a book by its publisher34 so i got this awesome phone a week ago i was totally looking forward to the sony xperia z1 as it has similar specs as lg g2 you can compare this two flagships on youtube  or i personally recommand gsmarena website for point to point benchmark battles then i realized that sony xperia z1 has self screen cracking problem and in response the company will not take care of it at all in only india just because it is developing country so it will be useless to have waterproof and elegant device if we are not secure after sell service is bad other devices under this price range are full of crap believe me please go to the gsmarena for better comparison but as theyre not aware of sonys racist point of view for india keep in mind that unlike other countries sony wont replace your precious device if it is cracked  you guyz may find this review has more of xperia z1s comparison to lg g2 but trust me in this price range with 22 ghz processor 2 gigs of ram best of graphics best of camera full hd resolution and trust youll find only in these twos  main pros if found in lg g2 are 1 battery king youll be surprised 2 5234 screen and its arrangement 3 optical image stabilization of camera refer gsmarena site for better camera review 4 screen on off function  cons its quite annoying that sound quality could have been batter it is not anywhere near to sony or htc in this segment  so it is completely up to you to buy it or not happy shopping
8843	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	nice on time service gr8 job mobile was absolutely brand new seald pack with best price yet from all over india
8844	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	i bought it through amazon about a month ago one day delivery provided by amazon the phone is as per expectations and more great android phone and great value for money on all parameters such as feature set camera build quality battery life screen i am still exploring it would recommend it highly and remember lg is a chosen vendor for google and making nexus for google
8845	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	superb phone one of the best in the market would recommend this over nexus anyway unless you are an android developer the ui interface is excellent
8846	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	i really liked the product very much  its picture quality batter backup are awsome i am getting almost 2 days battery life once charged even though i am browsing gaming and calls for the whole day however i was little disappointed to wait almost 1015 days to get the product delivered as the seller choose to send the product in gati courier services roadways not by any other airway couriers
8847	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	in this range of smart phone this phone is a beast in itself with zero lag buttery experience and amazing build quality not at all looking cheap gives it a premium feel  ui  its bit heavy but believe me you will experience no lag at all  performance  as i mentioned no lag means its so snappy to multitask with this phone 20 to 25 apps running in background but this is too little amount for this beast gives awesome performance in all the case all heavy games and apps runs smoothly  battery  3000mah battery is enough to make to a power beast  build quality  despite of poly carbonate plastic used by lg its not at all looks cheap and due to its sleek design its a eye catchy phone awesome build with premium look  overall  i am fully satisfied with this smartphone from lg  recommended  
8848	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	this is the best android cell as if now full marks for this cell i will recommend lg g2if any one willing to purchase a best android cell
8849	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	guys i have used this phone for past 1 month and no hint of problems or even lag  battery life is very good and it last one full day even on heavy usage  there is no heating issues the phone becomes warm when playing high graphic intensive games you will get used to the back button in a few days the only con is that u need to use a case for the phone as its a bit slippery  this has no problems and provides an amazing experience i recommend that u use nova launcher the samsung galaxy s4 has a heating issue it constantly lags even in home screen  i highly recommend lg g2 phone over the s4 for anyone looking for a all round package
8850	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	if you are looking for the beast then it is herebought it 5 months ago and till now no lag  it mammothtry it
8851	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	this phone has the best of all the things that matters the most  display camera performance battery life light weight  only place where it lags behind not by big margin though is its plastic back cover though it is durable but it feels little cheap but again most people put cover over such a premium phone so it doesnt really matter much second concern which people have is its volume and power button placement it does take some time to get used to them but after a while there is no going back plus the knock on feature does justify those button placements
8852	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	excellent price good product good packaging fair delivery speed
8853	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	its awesome in all ways best buy
8854	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	amazing phone i am using since 9 months
8855	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	lg g2 is one of the best android phones you can buy today lg has lately started to produce quality devices and google has chosen none other than lg to push out their nexus 4 and nexus 5 devices  features 52inch 1920 x 1080 display 424 ppi  qualcomm msm8974 snapdragon 800 with a 226ghz quadcore krait 400  same as in nexus 5  2 gb ram 16gb and 32gb variants 13 mp camera 3000mah lipo battery  pros great 1080p display with a high pixel per inch density 441  great camera with optical stabilization to counter camera shakes this gives you blur free images and better low light performance image quality is not up to that level of htc oneor some high end lumia devicesbut the quality is still greatg2s hdr mode works well  1080p 60 fps video capture is supported and the quality of the video is good there are some focusing issues though  this device is a power house which means high end games and apps can be run without any lags adreno 330 graphics processor makes things really smooth  good battery backup  3000mah battery may not be that big considering the huge display it has to power up still the battery backup is very solid  it has volume and power buttons on the back cover for easier access  this can be considered as a con depending on your preference though   cons design is not that attractive no sdcard slot lgs custom ui on top of android jellybean is a mixed bagsome prefer stock android experience over custom ones  this will get android kitkat update for surebut how long will it take remains to be seen  benchmarks quadrant  19000 antutu  32000  overall a good flagship phone from lg with high end specs competing directly with samsung galaxy s4 and htc one  lgs own nexus 5 comes with almost the same specs but runs stock kitkat android and is priced a few thousands lesser
8856	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	ordered and got the phone in less than 48 hours  the device is excellent and no issues found so far  the performance is awesomeinstalled asphalt8 and assassins creed piratesworks awesome  the available memory is only 105 out of 16 gb and will seem insufficient after few months of use  the battery is not very awesomebut covers my entire day with full day wifi and few calls and an hour of games  rest of the stuffs like look  feel sound and call quality are excellent and no problems  the cons from my side is i had to check with almost 15 local shops before getting original screen guard and flip cover for g2 as most of them do not stock for lg g2better to buy online along with the phonealso i do not find any lg phone showrooms even in phoenix malls
8857	LG G2 D802 (Black, 16GB)	tejas

8859	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	same phone in flipkart only 20k y the huge diff
8860	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	have 2 phones of this both 4g and 3g version yes video quality and photo quality is excellent storage is an issue
8861	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	i give it a five star for the build and the camera the polycarbonate unibody is fantastic it looks premium and then the camera its an amazing camera best if u love photography and want a smartphone that can act as ur dslrbut then it comes with some cons toothe amoled display is good but then its only 720p so thats on the backside its kinda small should have been a 5incherand right now at this price point its not a good deal
8862	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	this is a highend mobile plus camera aimed at users with very specific needs thus it is not a mobible phone for the average user who would have a budget of less than one tenth the cost of this mobile phone  anyone who finds himself traveling continually on road and in air who might have to shoot highquality photographs at a moments notice and who cannot always carry a camera in hand with himself will find the 41mp camera of this mobile very handy surprising moments that need to be captured by a camera do not come with prior announcement that turned out to be my primary interst and fascination with this mobile which is otherwise overpriced for the average user  there are numerous items of technical specification but the most important ones for me are    powered by windows phone 8 os and 2 gb ram   wireless charging very useful   15 ghz qualcomm snapdragon s4 dual core processor   music apps nokia music mix radio   carl zeiss tessar lens an amazing lens   full hd 1080p recording   comes with ms office and free voiceguided navigation   41 mp primary camera with optical image stabilisation very important for quick shoots   12 mp secondary camera no longer of much use but is ok  i strongly recommend this gadget for those special users who need such portability and power
8863	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	exceptionally good phone for imaging cons  os crashes once in a while overheats
8864	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	the camera is the best look is very good the only thing is the poor app base in windows of course it is no fault of the phone
8865	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	very low screen resolution compared to other phone at 13rd of its price operating system stinks if you damage anything in this phone the repair is going to cost you more than a brand new full hd res phone i paid 11k for a faulty sim slot which nokia care refused to repair under warranty for a 4 months old phone
8866	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	error error unable to find a bootable option press any key to shut down before you think of purchasing any lumia phone  please surf on google for the given error there is no exact reason known why phones working perfect suddenly cease to function and display this error error unable to find a bootable option press any key to shut down on the screen with a black background none of the recovery tools on the microsoft website or anywhere else cannot repair this phone the nokia care also is unaware why this happens and ask their customers to replace the motherboard which costs 90 of the cost  there are thousands of customers who are facing this problem and have their lumia phones turned into paperweights  please inform your friends if they have any lumia phone to use very carefully  i have myself used the phoen and no doubt nokia made a perfect masterpiece but microsoft windows on this phone sucks and microsoft itself still havent came forward with any of software to get it sorted so think before u purchase
8867	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	price is still high 
8868	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	  you might have thought that this is a brittle phone from what nokia claims and the advertisements but that8217s not the case its very fragile not like its predecessor i dropped this phone from my pocket a few days back and the display broke and this is just a 20 days old phone i just dropped it that one time  this is the same lumia 1520 that nokia claims to be strong a durable one  i have used nokia n95 and nokia lumia 800 both were durable dropped it so many times and never broke especially the lumia 800 which my wife is still using has been dropped a million times still works like a charm not even a scratch so looks like this flagship model lumia 1520 is not made of the same quality as its predecessor and its pretty much fragile  when i contacted nokia about this they said due to this physical damage my mobile is now out of warranty i have to cover the expenses now it costs around 200 to replace the display come on i cant spend 200 every time i drop this phone  i should have bought a case but the problem with the case is that this mobile is already huge enough to handle with one hand this case might increase the size a bit and i thought atending the calls would become tedious and considering the durability of lumia 800 which i already own i thought this phone would also be made of good quality this phone tends to slip out easily out of my hands as its huge and weighs a lot nokia service centre ignored my case even though i am a loyal customer i have always been a nokia customer apart from the nokia n95 and lumia 800 i have bought several other phones including the e5 and many other models which ofcourse i dont remember now they have been mailing me mail templates instead of a proper reply  even though i explained my case several times they are not ready to replace the phone instead they wanna consider my case as a feedback  all these nokia flagships phones have been very sentimental to me and i was very heartbroken when this mobile broke never broke a phone before and nokia is not ready to help me out  so if u are really considering to buy this lumia 1520 be ready to spend 200 every time you drop it
8869	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	41 mp have already beaten some costly dslrs and all phones are beaten by this phone in photography it gives extreme zoom and clear crisp pictures at night too cauz it has great low lightning or if you dont believe then click  httpswwwbingcomimagessearchqnokia1020fullresolutionformiqfrdr
8870	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	my friends asked me about the price and i told them their reaction came with a comment like had you bought a bike of this price entire society would have seen and appraised ha ha  little hurting but when the features are seen and when the use is experienced this is awesome truly awesome8230  i had fedup with andriod phones for their poor battery backups and nokia lumia 1020 is great on battery performance i charged it to 80 on friday when i first open it and then i started using it in exploring manner  camera is also another great of course as expected because that is the selling point of this device for the company it take two snaps at a time one for 05mp for quick sharing and another for 36mp for high resolution and let me tell here i have not seen such a performance in any mobile camera i zoomed the pictures by 10times are even more and yet the sharpness sustained and pixcels did not break no much distortions like any other camera when i compared its still snaps with the still snaps taken with panasonic hcv720 camcorder 201 mp i would nokia lumia 1020 performance beats panasonic hcv720 with great margins i in fact loved the performance  downloading on 2g is also impressive and there were no breaks in the songs played on nokiamusic store  the animated home is full of live information quick links and handy to use  only miss from android phone is a single panel for all updates but this problem is solved in alternate ways in windows interface  i an overall i would recommend the product this in fact worth to buy for this prices at least for me
8871	Nokia Lumia 1020 (Black)	of course windows is the phuture right fineus anyone buying orange no sorry thats lemon darn wrong again i mean apple products might as well sit under a tree to discover  or maybe youll invent g r a v i t y  wow see what i mean hey mate im british and high poor guys on crack

8878	Lava Magnum X604 (White)	lava magnum x604 is a quadcore dual sim handset running android kitkat   highlights and review   display and build quality  this is phablet sized the display is a 6inch720p245 ppi one with good viewing angles the build quality and design are excellent even the flip cover included in the box is of good quality the back panel is matte finished giving it good grip  android kitkat  442  1gb ram  kitkat and 1gb ram works well in letting you to day to day tasks without much issues  quadcore processor  unlike many other budget devices out there this is not powered by a mediatek mtk6582 chipset rather its powered by a 12ghz broadcom chipset performancewise this lags behind mtk6582 quadcore processor and can be clearly seen when you play games on this device many hd games need to be set to lowest graphics in order to work lag free  2800 mah battery  it can easily last one whole day of average use with wifidata on  sensors  accelerometerproximity sensor and light sensor  camera  8mp rear and 2mp front you can get good pics in good lighting contitions from the rear cameranothing revolutionarybut gets the job done 1080p video recording is supported   misc info  5 point multitouch otg is supportedyou can plugin your pendrive via an otg cable installation of apps on to the sdcard is supported antutu benchmark score 14700 while mt6582 devices scores around 17000 nenamark  30fps while 6582 scores around 55fps   verdict i would have very much liked this phone if it had come with better performing quadcore mt6582 instead of the broadcom 12ghz quadcore  videocore iv gpu the phone often lags apart from the processor there isnt much to complain about the phone if you are power gamer i would recommend other ones as the processor gpu combination is not that powerful to play hd heavy games for general use this is quite an excellent phone to ownand is not over priced
8879	Lava Magnum X604 (White)	i have bought this phone from last 10 days ago 11400 rs from amazon its lcd screen automatic cracked in my pocket and when i go to lava service center to repair they told me the repairing amount is 6900 rs inr bullshit mobile cost is 11400 and lcd repairing is 6900 i am totally disappointed to join this company
8880	Lava Magnum X604 (White)	it is quite a good value for money  i was amazed to speed of delivery within 3 days  lava should initiate a high pressure campaign for this model as the comparable model of other brand is far more expensive  except the slight lag in tight reactionit is a pleasure to possess it  i have recommended this model to many of my friend  it has almost replaced my notebook  thanks to lava
8881	Lava Magnum X604 (White)	big screen phones seem to be the new thing these days with more and more manufacturers bringing out phones with bigger and bigger screens while i was always curious about owning a big screen phone i never actually bought one because they were usually too expensive or had woeful specifications i think lava may have planted a bug in my brain as they launched the lava magnum x604 a phablet with good specifications and features at a price that won8217t punch my bank account so i finally bit the bullet and entered the world of phablets  initial impressions  the first thing i noticed when i got the box was how compact it was and the same feeling continued when i opened it and laid eyes on the phone i guess like many other people i bet i was expecting a phablet to be as big as my nexus 7 but it8217s actually very compact and thin as well the first thing i did was put it in my pocket and walk about a bit and it wasn8217t too bulky and uncomfortable which was a pleasant surprise  the phablet also came with all the goodies you expect along with a flip cover and a screen guard as well  powering up the surprises continued when i powered it on the huge screen hd is brilliant after the usual start up sequence of putting in your email and everything that you have to do for every android phone the main menu came up first thing which i did was swipe about the menu screen and get a feel for the device i must say that while everything is nice and peppy there is a micro second of lag when i compare it to my nexus 7 although it was better than my old android phone  the inbuilt selections of apps were pretty decent and there doesn8217t seem to be anything that8217s pointless next stop was the camera and the display  camera and display the magnum boasted an 8 mp camera and i was ready to stretch it to its paces the camera is very good and the pictures it takes are phenomenal for its price the phone seems to be very good for normal usage and works pretty decently with macro shots the low light photography capability is pretty average though it is good enough to post pics and stuff  the display is quite sharp and is really detailed checking out the pictures that i clicked as well as some of the pre installed wallpapers was my first taste of it but watching hd videos and movies is something else entirely the large screen means that you don8217t have to squint to see details and gives a nice feel to the phone thing it8217s perfect for people on the go who love movies but don8217t have time to watch it at home  battery and conclusion  the phone comes with a 2800 mah battery which is much bigger than my old phone and hence works longer as well the phone easily lasts for an entire day of heavy to moderate use after a charging it through the night  one the whole i really enjoyed using the magnum x604 and i would go so far as to say that i changed my perception of phablets in general i feel that this a great phone for anyone considering a phablet on a large screen device that is feature rich and doesn8217t cost much
8882	Lava Magnum X604 (White)	bought lava magnum x604 phablet in last august 2014 from bareilly up market only draw back is very little space ie about 1 gb for apps though the inbuilt space is 8 gb in most of cases insufficient memories restrict applications downloading
8883	Lava Magnum X604 (White)	this phone is good in all but it doesnt have its back case cover it will be pleasure for me if someone tell me about similar back case suited with this magnum phone
8884	Lava Magnum X604 (White)	everything in this mobile is good but battery geetting low soon

8888	HTC Desire 600 (Dual SIM, White)	i was looking for a phone which is value for money and this is the one i almost researched for 45 months and ultimately zeroed into this product really amazing and i would say perfect from all angles pros 1 very slim and light weight 45 inches screen is just perfect i feel 5 inch bulky and out of the pocket d  2 nice plastic used in back cover front is aluminium body 3 very smooth touch  just like apples iphone 4 long battery life  lasts more than a day with all time 3g internet active without internet 2 days 5 most of your battery conservation is due to the htc customisation to the android which cuts off internet when the phone is locked and is in power saver mode 6 beats audio is awesome and equally very good quality canal earphones 7 camera is very good quality and better than iphone4s camera  self tested the front camera is equally good and i use it for skype 8 1 gb ram is good enough with internal 45 gb usable memorytotal is 8 gb i have expanded 32 gb memory and usage is without any lag transcend microsdhc 32 gb class 10 for rs 1375 9 call transmissions is very good my call used to drop frequently while using my previous phone with the same mobile subscriber but with this phone the call drop has stopped completely for the same route on gurgaon highway  cons 1 though i didnt find any but lately i discovered that the radio transmission is not good at all and i would never ever like to listen to fm with this phone but when you have beats audio why to use fm just download 360kbps quality songs and enjoy
8889	HTC Desire 600 (Dual SIM, White)	nice phone well designed with dual sim function looking ahead for more purchases like htc desire 600 a real gadget

8902	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (White)	ive been using this phone for over a year now it is a good mid range device which excels in most key areas but unfortunately falls short in some others the 45 inch screen size makes it handier than most smartphones today where a 5 inch screen is the norm the screen is vibrant and sharp sonys music quality output through earphones is as good as ever the quad core processor and 2 gbs of ram leave no room for complaints and the phone is zippy ill go ahead and highlight some areas which might be a cause for potential buyers and users alike 1 the front camera is a vga camera which is sad to be honest its performance is poor to say the least 2 despite being backed by a 13 mp sensor the back camera is inconsistent its a decent camera35 but theres more noise in the pictures than id like to see its performance in low light is mediocre 3 wifi and 3g usage sap the battery a little too quickly 4 the internal storage of the phone is 8 gb which would be a cause for trouble if you download too many applications not many applications can be moved to the sd card 5 sonys version of the android os is bloated with too many useless applications on the plus side however stock applications like walkman album and the video player are beautifully crafted and a joy to use 6 the flaps that cover the usb port and headphone jack are flimsy in fact they gave up on me after a year of usage which also means my phone is no longer water resistant  this phone is a very decent buy overall over a year and 3 months and its still running pretty strong for me
8903	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (White)	its a great phone only thing i wish for is that it should have bit more battery charge lasting otherwise it met all my expectations
8904	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (White)	pros great camera decent battery life 2 gb ram quad core qualcomm cpu great performance  cons vga front camera  waiting for android 44 update

8906	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (White)	product is perfectly fine even then i had to go to sony service center few days after upgrading the device to 43 jellybean i got good service free of cost and took barely 30min
8907	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (White)	for 1 year i was using this superb handset which also got 44 kitkat update from sony toobut problem comes at 13th month of regular day usage when mine headphone port got problem and not producing sound right on headphones  thats a small problem i thought and went to service center for repair but got 128562shocked from their reply they said that this phone they dont have authorisation to open  so it means it is unrepairable yes you heard right if you got any problem at all they will not do anything and they suggested better to use phone in that way or you have to replace handset only which also costs me much much more than repairing port as they suggested now i am using this phone with defaulted port which i thing was the part of my normal day to listen to music  so im using my old micromax cell for music
8908	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (White)	since own many sony prducts like led tvshome thetrecamerasetcetc i wanted a mobile phone which goes well with these productsxperia zr does this job quite wellyet to experiment its underwater perfomance
8909	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (White)	hangs frequently not sure if the product is faulty or its because of android never used android before windows os is pretty stable except for whatsapp on lumia 710 camera is ok nothing extra ordinary speed is good
8910	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (White)	it is a nice mobile sony delivers a good product i like mobile features which i like to use it
8911	Sony Xperia ZR C5502 (White)	this is a slightly more expensive model in this series but has several merits i have always been a fan of the xperia series it is one of the most successful series by sonly also formerly or sony errickson and over the years i have used a number of models from this series  actually i came across this series a few years ago when i was looking for a phone with the following characteristics  1 very compact 2 easy to use 3 superb camera quality 4 reasonable price  i found that the experia series met all the above requirements  this model from the series maintains all the above features but at the same time it has improved upon all the features and specifications those who have used the earlier models will be pleased at the vast improvements those for whom this is the firsttime buy of a machine from this series it will surely give a pleasant surprise  the increased cost is ok when one considers the enhancements one finds in this model
8912	Micromax Bolt A61 (Grey)	very little internal memory so you must add the cost of a sd card to the total cost without sd card this is no more than a basic phone i installed just one application  facebook which exhausted all available internal memoryto install whatsapp i must now add a sc card and swap some apps from internal to sd to make space  i dont have anything running except for facebook on a 8mbps wifi the pages are painfully slow to load  pictures are very dull and colors and totally washed out one needs to be outdoors or have very bright light to get respectable pictures the flash is a joke its a dull led light that you will barely notice
8913	Micromax Bolt A61 (Grey)	the battery back up is very low and memory is too low to install any application but the good part is that the display is excellent covers almost all the features of a smart phone
8914	Micromax Bolt A61 (Grey)	good phone weight mentioned in amazon details is wrong 296grm lesser than samsung galaxy trend  s duos big screen
8915	Micromax Bolt A61 (Grey)	best of micromax like a116 all features under 5000 superb phone from micromax rate is more go for it 
8916	HTC Desire Xc (Dual SIM, White)	this is not good mobile as expected on site it is written 4 gb internal memory but after get and see the configuration found that it has only 1gb internal memory battery backup is very low headphone provided with handset is worst one taking too long time to get fully charged almost 6 hours  over all i am not happy with this product
8917	HTC Desire Xc (Dual SIM, White)	camera is disappointing user interface is bit tricky biggest of all accessories are not available in retail market or service centers for this model
8918	HTC Desire Xc (Dual SIM, White)	the glass screen has developed a crack  i must admit that the set slipped off and fell on the ground once  the battery life at optimum use is not more than 12 hours  otherwise it is cute
8919	HTC Desire Xc (Dual SIM, White)	nice phone n got what iwant in cdma range

8933	Panasonic P41 (Pearl White)	panasonic p41 is excellent in looks very light with all the attributes of satisfying a customer in various portals vast difference in price which is surprising  some fake customers review is totally biased and devoid of ground reality having  handled  many prestiages brands i rrate new launch p61 p41 and eluga u the best in all spheres only drawback in p41 is that it would have been internal memory of 16gb instead of 8 and better publicity of the product i forecast with better quality launches panasonic be atrusted  brand
8934	Panasonic P41 (Pearl White)	nice product for the budget in the pack i got one extra screen gaurd and flip cover earphones with ear buds peloaded wit kitkat  battey life is good decent performance screen with good resolution no lagging while playing game over all petty much happy with the phone
8935	Panasonic P41 (Pearl White)	panasonic p41 is a budget android kitkat device released along with its brothers p61 and t41 dont be surprised if you cant see these devices listed on official panasonic india mobile website they are yet to update it thereeven after being notified of the missing devices  highlights and review 1 android kitkat  far better than android jellybean in terms of performance panasonic has added some useful features on top of it 2 quadcore 13ghz mtk6582 processor and mali400 mp2 gpu  this combination is a well proven oneand is seen on many budget devices in the marketmany high end games can be played without much lagthough some you need to put to medium graphics level 3 1 gb ram  ensures decent multitasking 4 5 inch lcd display with a qhd resolution 540 x 960 pixels 220 ppi  5 8mp rear and 2mp front shooter good enough for your sharing needs 1080p video is supported 6 2000mah battery  can last a day of average use if you are a heavy user probably you would need to find a charging port by evening   verdict p41 has the same processorgpu combination seen on rs 7000 one micromax canvas unite 2 and many other under 10k budget 1gb ram devices so if you are looking for performance i think its better to choose other ones that cost lesser and comes with a bigger battery if you want a good branded one with a better screen and resolutionand a better camera overallthis can fit your needs keep in mind that there are devices from other well known players xologioneeiball etc at this same price range offering goodif not better specs for eg recently announced iball andi sparkle ships with an octa core one priced around rs10500 check out youtube for some video reviews if any before buying this to know more about the performance and software

8937	Lenovo Ideaphone S890 (White)	things i liked   quite good looks   meets all the expectation for a new android phone camera screen size graphics etc   os is customized well   processor which i thought to be a negative point while buying is fine and very fast   and ofcourse the price range  things could have been made better   after long calls without earphones i feel some heat from it   its heavy weighs much more than other phones   2gb out of the offered 4gb memory cannot be used for certain apps as it is considered as usb memory
8938	Lenovo Ideaphone S890 (White)	think before you buy this products i bought lenovo s890 in may 2013 1 finding spare parts like cover original that comes is phone is not possible check any website 2 its sensor are not proper due to which google maps doesnt work properly 3 no update are available on lenovo 4 it is still providing jelly beans operating system 5 memory appers to be 1gb but its not optimised properly due to which phone becomes slow  due courese of time
8939	Lenovo Ideaphone S890 (White)	wonderful product at wonderful price  good android phone will all required features and a  sturdy frame a must have 
8940	Lenovo Ideaphone S890 (White)	best phone at this price no lag and awesome screen resolution build quality is superb no problem with the phone
8941	Lenovo Ideaphone S890 (White)	great performancevalue for money the touch is very responsive and smooth the screen is very bright and colorful battery lasts for one day  games like temple run 2 dr driving angry birds running very smooth with out any lag very elegant look only one problem what i have observed is the 4gb internal memory is partitioned to 2gb internal memory and 2 gb usb drive the internal memory is full with the installation of some apps and some of them are unable to move to usb storage so struggling to install high file size apps overall value for money and great performance

8954	Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (Black)	before this purchase my intention was to find a good business phone therefore call quality email text messaging internet connection battery life and reliability were the most important features i did a lot of research and based on the excellent reviews of this phone from existing users and professional reviewers i decided to buy battery life on this phone is fantastic and one of the reasons i bought it i can often get 3 days out of it and sometimes it lasts into the 4th day and with heavy usage i will get 2 days call quality is excellent and the sony android interface is easy to use very fast and highly customizable size is just right and small enough to fit in your pocket easily while still having a big enough screen to read website pages without any issues my last phone was a windows phone and the android interface on this phone makes the windows phone interface look at least 2 or 3 generations behind ive had it for about 1 month with no issues so am very happy i would advise getting screen protectors front and back as the existing protectors scratch very easily
8955	Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (Black)	well this is my first time writing a review bought this phone 2 12 weeks ago and have been using it constantly i absolutely love this phone for various reasons explained below  looks  size this phone is beautiful has a great premium feel and feels awesome in the hand im back to 1 handed typing and use again the way it was meant to be sure a smaller screen means lesser real estate for reading and watching videos but trust me unless u plan to watch movies on ur phone for 56 hours everyday then its not suitable otherwise for watching youtube and music videos this thing works well for me being a corporate lawyer i use my phone for a lot of reading articles emails etc i was worried that the screen size would pose a problem but that dint happen reading is just as comfortable as before  battery life the battery life is super lasts me the whole day with heavy use and i mean from 730 am to 11 pm consider that it has a 2300 mah battery the same as a galaxy s3 but a smaller screen and better processor therefore giving a better battery life as regards the usage of my phone bbmwhatsapptwitter through the day alongwith 230 of calls 3g internet whole day youtube streaming emails apps etc  display not sure what everyone is complaining about viewing angles and brightness my phone is set to the minimum brightness levels possible and its bright as my old s3 if not brighter did not notice any issues with vieiwing angles  xperia transfer took me about 15 minutes to set up this phone thanks to the xperia transfer app it moved all contacts music pics videos from my s3 to this one i was pretty impressed  android 44 has been released for this phone however i havent yet downloaded this so my review os based on 43 there is absolutely no lag time in changing apps flipping shutting deleting etc works like perfect  sound the sound quality is awesome and the walkman app is just too cool its much more convenient than the music player on galaxy devices and more customisable than an iphone songs app i just put in my 64 gig memory card and there were all my music and videos the sound is awesomeon calls or for music on the loudspeakerearphones  accessories considering its a brfand new model the accessories are not as easily available in the shops i had to order the case and screen guard separately and that also online from amazon i ordered the cruzerlite bugdroid case in black its looks good and provides decent protection have dropped my phone once and the case worked without complaint  oh yes and i did dunk this phone in a beer mug and it survived also use it to take calls in the shower hah that freaked out my girl she was like wats that shiny black thing and i was like shiny disco balls fool its my sony xperia z1 and lets get freeaky  im really happy with my purchase man go for it if you want a high end future proof phone in a decent screen size that actually fits in one hand its a beauty
8956	Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (Black)	i really enjoyed this mobile the size is smaller and after using note 2 did find little difficulty  but its more better with grip and has excellent underwater capabilities enjoyed taking photographs during my holidays
8957	Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (Black)	the charger sent by the seller was of american model didnt fit up in my houses socket luckily i had a samsung charger through which am charging it currently screen seems small ui wasnt smooth while playing subway surf had more fun with micromax mobiles no network since days inspite of following the guidelines provided at xperia support forum keeps on hanging doesnt work smoothly ui is totally poor bad buy cant believe i wasted 25k on this pathetic phone shouldve bought micromax  and yeah i just cant hear the sound at all

8962	Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (Black)	all item is best
8963	Sony Xperia Z1 Compact (Black)	sony is starting a new trend by introducing a flagship device in a small sizewhich is rarely seen today xperia z1 compact has a 720 x 1280 pixels 43 inches display and packs the same processor and gpu seen in the bigger xperia z1 released earlier the original z1 suffered from pure viewing angleswhich sony has addressed and solved in this compact version  apart from the screen sizeonly other notable difference is the battery this has a 2300mah one while the bigger xperia z1 has a 3000mah one  the performance of the device is awesome it can play high end games and hd videos without any lags thanks to its powerful processorgpu combination 2gb of ram ensures smooth multitasking  camera performance this has a 20 mp cameraand performs fast and gives good image quality in good light howeverit still suffers in low light conditions with visible noise in images sony as always provides a dedicated shutter button which is a great thing the camera app has many useful features to assist taking better and a variety of photos  since the device got smallerthe battery also got a little smaller 2300mah with stamina mode from sony can get you through a day of moderate usage  verdict  overall a good compact phonewith great internal specs and a 720p display however if you like a bigger devicewith a better display and batterythe original z1 would be a better buy as it is priced only a few thousands more than this currently

8972	Samsung Galaxy Mega 5.8 I9152 (Black)	good product but if it would have been with quad core processor then no one could beat thisstill not bad one can go for this
8973	ZEN Ultrafone 701HD (Black)	it is better than all other phones  first i am affraid to purchase this phone because of brand but when i got it it is suppppppppeeeeeeerrrrrrrb phone speed is very good ips screen camera is also good quad core 1gb ram 5inch screen 3mp front 8mp back camera  you never got this type of mobile in this price  just go for this

8975	ZEN Ultrafone 701HD (Black)	first day as a user of the device  ran hd videos and installed many apps etc works seamlessly and flawlessly so far  it has a good display ips hd decent camera 8mp 3mp and a wonderful price for the overall feature pack 12 ghz 1 gb 4 gb it has it also got an android firmware update which makes it better  on durability  only time will tell how durable the device is but frankly i am not expecting it to last more than two years with the pace at which technology is changing with this price 608k i think it is quite affordable to use the best feature set and then change to a newer device in two years
8976	ZEN Ultrafone 701HD (Black)	recommended for everyone who is looking for a top feature phone in a budjet rateand by the way no one knows that this mobile has power graphics and antutu benchmark score is 13980ive installed about 40 apps totally and its working flawlesslyno force closesand to say bout its camerait has got very good cam perofomance unlike tha lie fact of micromaxs 8mpit has got modified customised cam for more optionseis stabilisationbattery works fine and lasts upto one day if u have battery doctor on a heavy data usage  cons network reception is somewat badbut if u live in city or where the network is ful u can go with it
8977	ZEN Ultrafone 701HD (Black)	writing the review standing as of today might be a bit old considering the product launch date but considering a good performing phone at rs8000 this one would be highly recommended you can find many reviews in youtubegoogle so will not waste space here but its the first time i went off from reputed brand names to a somewhat lesser known brand  and honestly am not disappointed i might go for the brand name zen again in the future kudos to zen for bringing out an honest good product at reasonable price
8978	ZEN Ultrafone 701HD (Black)	brought this phone 10 days back so far no issues performance is good no logging at all screen display also good i am a moderate useri didnt find any issues which are reported earlier over the web i guess all have addressed by software updates its my first buy from saholic very good service speed delivery didnt expect though its great value for money phone
8979	ZEN Ultrafone 701HD (Black)	i have order this phone and was delivered on time i have got a defected phone and saholic team had helped me and sent me a new one even this phone has lots of problem im not satisfied by the phone the phone specification had sound great but it fails in reality  the phone has some problem every time i make a phone call the screen turn off and will not turn on until the person who has answered your call has to end the call yes you head right since the screen is turned off automatically you cant even end the phone call i have really made a mistake purchasing this phone for the same price you will get a better phone and a good brand  in regards to the pricing i lot my trust on amazon i have purchased many products from amazon since 2009 in usa and i though they will provide the same quality of service and transparency in the indian version of amazon i have purchase this phone for 7999 rs and my invoice also clearly shows 7999 rs but i was charged 8544 rs on my card this is not acceptable  amazon needs to rectify this at the earliest
8980	ZEN Ultrafone 701HD (Black)	this phone is extremely good for the price its offered although its a bit outdated on its os 421 still manages to perform well highly recommended pros performance dual sim looks price attractive box 2 extra changeable back covers white  black flip cover cons heavier than note 3 phablet thickness old os 421

9001	Gionee Elife E6 (Black)	the build quality of this device is awesome it doesnt look like a cheap chinese phone at all  on the software sidethis ships with a custom ui on top android jellybean 42 this custom ui is heavy compared to the stock ui you see on many other devices which makes it more resource hungry the ui is largely inspired by apple iphoneone other thing to talk about is the camera13mp rear camera performs quite well outdoorsbut gets noisy when light drops 5mp camera front cam is good enough for video calling  the processorgpu combination is the same as the one you see in other 1080p devices like micromax turboxolo q3000 etc  one of the common mistakes widely seen in indian market with full hd 1080p display phones is the low capacity battery gionee elife e6 too suffers from that this has a great 1080p 441ppi screenbut more pixels you cram inmore power it consumes with 2000mah batteryit would be hard to last you one whole day of average use so not recommended at all if you are heavy internet user  verdict  a very well built phone with premium looks but ships with only 2000mah battery the screen quality is top notch and everything looks great on this 1080p screen since micromax knight is outwhich ships with an octa core processorand is priced the same as thisi would recommend going for that instead if you want a device with a huge battery and 1080p displaythen xolo q3000 is the right device to get as it ships with a 4000mah battery micromax turbo is another device to considercomes cheaper than thiswith almost the same internals
9002	Gionee Elife E6 (Black)	a great phone with great features at a great price though the display is sharp and clear colours seem oversaturated some times it offers more features than any phone under the range of 25k  the only disappointment from this phn was that it lacks black screen gesture feature which gionee offers even in its low range phones such as gionee m2 priced at rs 105k  review after using for 8 months   no kitkat update till date  the phone is great but it still hasnt got its kitkat update and it wont be getting one which is a huge dissapointment beacuse its predecessor gionee elife e3 has got one and even the gionee mobioes priced at 10k such as gionee m2 gionee says e6 has restricted hw capabilities wtf   average battery backup 2000mah avg battery backup is also a huge let down for such a great phone   no otg support again a disspointment for a phone at rs 20 k dont you think
9003	Gionee Elife E6 (Black)	the phone is amazingly good and very much satisfied with its performance very superior built and cannot believe this phone prised at only about rs 20000 it has got crisp n clear display the sound quality is excellent 13mp camera is good and fully satisfied  with the quality of front camerafor video callingthis phone is not getting heat up during prolonged use which is more common in other phones during the data usage  in gsm mode and wcdma mode the fully charged battery drain out in about 24hrs and in wcdmagsm mode dual mode it reduses to about 1012hrs if the data connection is switched off then it stays for more than 36 hrs exact duration in this mode i didnt check but used the phone for abour 36 hrs without rechargingn still battery charge was lefton an average once in 24hrs i am charging my phonegenerally i use it in wcdma3g mode i am fully satisfied with its overall performance
9004	Gionee Elife E6 (Black)	i have been using this phone for last 3 months so far so good thanks to the seller for prompt delivery on time

9010	Gionee Elife E6 (Black)	no battery is not up to the mark hardly it works 7 hours
9011	Gionee Elife E6 (Black)	performance is good even in low budget
9012	Gionee Elife E6 (Black)	this phone is not good i used for about 11 months but after that screen light goes off all other features work but i was unable to see anything on screen gionee service is bad they did not repaired my handset just told me that their was moisture in set ie it stop working  asked for 7000 for replacing its motherboard wat the hell i pay 20000 for this handset  now due to moisture which is quiet common in mobile i have to pay for that this mobile is just a waste

9026	Xolo Q2000 (White)	xolo q2000 is a mid range under 15k device its a decent device with good specs and allbut there are some issues need to be noted before buying this  pros  1 good 55 inch 720p screen 267 ppi 2 stock android experiencethe same ui that you see on nexus devices 3 it doesnt look cheapgood looks 4 huge battery 2600mah  it can last 2 days of average use 5 otg support  you can plugin usb pendrives using an otg cable  cons  1 touch response in not that great 2 13 mp camera is just an average oneunder performs it can do 1080p videos though  3 this is powered by mtk6589 processor clocked at 12 ghz when other devices at this price range is powered by turbo mtk6589 processor clocked at 15 ghz this is not actually a big issue since you would hardly notice the difference most of the time both processors are powerful enough to manage multitasking and playing games like temple runsubway surfersfruit ninjariptide etc are enjoyable without any lags  there are other phones in the market shipping with a more powerful mtk6582 processor nowat a cheaper price  overall its a good product for its priceespecially battery is huge plus when comparing to other devices at this price range

9036	Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9300 (Pebble Blue)	it is truly said that s3 is desighned for humans i bought this phone because i loved its looks and that day it was available for 19990 has plenty of features which are available only in this phonelike smart staynfcsmart alert in drive modescreen mirroring  multi window has a 14 ghz quadcore processor and 1gb ram so you cant complain the back 80 mp  camera is superb and takes nice pics and the front camera is ok and music quality is also superb the best think i saw was the display i mean to say its super awesomethe clarity of colours and the displayand the screen size is the best 48 which can be easily operated by hands and fits nicely in poketthe battery lasts a day in normal brighrness but if you play heavy games like asphalt 8 then it will drain very quickly but for regular use its decentit is better than s3 neo because it has quadcore and neo comes with dual coreat last i would say that you will be happy after buying it this is my guarantee people will say that its old but you will not find such stylish sleek  handy phoneand the colour pebble blue looks nice and gives a rich feel better than htc as no one offer features which are available in s3finally dont listen to anyonejust listen to your heart and go for it

9077	LG G2 D802 (White, 16GB)	while the phone is great in every aspect i love the clever tricks in the ui it is not fingerprint magnet as some say but a solid built and very slim cool phone  my problem is not with the phone but with lgs discriminatory deal for customers in asia in us they are giving the quickwindow case along with the phone however here the phone doesnt have any moreover they are saving money by not giving the user manual too i tried to download from lg website but there isnt any the earphones which come with the phone have a very hard quality earpiece rubber and your ears will pain in no time i just replaced the rubber with old skull candy spares
9078	LG G2 D802 (White, 16GB)	i am completely in love with this mobile everything about this mobile speaks quality and class my first flagship mobile and how happy i am all the reviews available online has only good things to say about this mobile and i agree with each one of them extremely satisfied with amazon service and delivery oh  and icing on the cake was i got it at a price so low that i have not come across such a low price on any online site since the time i purchased according to me because of the price at which i got this mobile it is even vfm highly recommended

9080	LG G2 D802 (White, 16GB)	i got this phone few days back its awesome every phone has its own pros and cons but lg had made a lot of effort in collecting it and reducing all the cons as the tag line says 34learning form you34 it implemented all the pros in one  pros 1 a very good fhd ips display 2 start up time is very less stats up very fast 3 very fast processing thanks to snapdragon 800 23ghz 4 13 mp ois camera is too good 5 knock on feature is very convenient 6 camera features are too good 7 no need to install any app for changing theme or keyboard layout or theme and fonts its all built in u can download your favorite ones 8 3000 mah battery gives a good back up for a 52 inch screen 9 fhd video recording at 60 fps is very good 10 nice sound quality 11 2gb  ram allows you to run many apps 12 slide aside feature is too good and useful 13 audio zooming is the special feature of lg g2  cons i am using this mobile from past one week till now i didnt find any cons except the rear volume key and power key it just take a few more days to get used to it  so guys if you are planning to buy a nexus 5 i strongly recommend you to buy lg g2 instead of that
9081	LG G2 D802 (White, 16GB)	i used this phone very rarely but noticed that whenever the phone gets heat up due to processor usage or games the screen hangs and start typing and dialing and messaging etc itself  rest all is okay
9082	LG G2 D802 (White, 16GB)	its best in all aspects touch  feels amazing and differs you from all others camera  thanks to image stabilizer sound  quality is not good if compared with htc one display  perfect in short if you are bored of samsung  iphone just go for the g2

9130	Lenovo Ideaphone S720 (White)	i was earlier little hesitant to buy this phone since lenovo being new in smartphones market but lenovo has proven itself here as well first thanks to amazon for i found the most competitive price for this product only on amazon keep it up   now about the phone it has every thing what i need i am not a smartphone geek but what i know what i want from the phone fast performance gaming or videos without lags fairly decent  high resolution camera 8 mp and hd video recording ca 18 gb of user accessible internal memory is more than enough for an average user like me  design full marks  the design is stylish and easily comparable with a premium class samsung or htc  display lcd ips  quasi hd display crisp images and very eye pleasing 45  makes movies more enjoyable  camera 8 mp rear very much satisfactory led flash powerful  battery normal one and half day after normal usage  115 hr gaming 2 hrs music etc  sound quality excellent  speakers are really good and boosted by dolby digital best in headsets although call sound is average  no issue as such only what i noticed was if you set live or 3d wall papers then it lags by several seconds although it does not slow down one can manage that secondly considering the screen size power button should have been on the right side instead of top because it is difficult to reach the power button considering the size of the phone but thats manageable once we get used to it  accessories like screen guard and flip case are available online  so moral of the story highly recommended go for it
9131	Lenovo Ideaphone S720 (White)	i dont like anything in this phone and i am thinking why i brought this phone  its not at all worthable for 10k poor quality for cam even if this has 8pix also and boot up is very slow  i suggest dont go for this
9132	Lenovo Ideaphone S720 (White)	look and feel of the phone is very good camera performance is good but the phone lags while running applications even simple apps get force closed and its irritating a compromise and not worth of rs 10000 compared to other phones

9138	Micromax canvas play q355	overall a good phone with such a low budget here you get 8 gb internal memory with 1 gb ram further you get 5534 display phone with a butter smooth touch along with latest android version  lollipip  which is of very fast processor compared to  kitkat  display quality is so so because neither its superamoled nor with gorilla protection but you will see lightening speed in internet browsing and downloading sound quality is very good compared to samsung models ie samsung galaxy grand 2 etc only cons is that its camera which is poor compared to other same 5mp samsung phone camera secondly body look is not like smart strong and gorgeos as samsung models thirdly it has no direct video calling provision with such a heavy features for which i feel very sad because direct video calling and skype video calling has vast differenceif these drawbacks were meet up along with 15 gb ram than it will be a super duper hit and nothing else is expected

9164	Karbonn A11+(Black)	got some extra money to spend on crap  buy this phonestupid phone   hardware quality     i bought it 1 year ago  i had to send it for repairing more than 6 times in one year so i probably used it just for 6 months only  battery life     it has the worst battery life even if you charge it to 100 it wont run more than 6 hours moreover it heats up fast so the battery dies even faster  processor   the processor is not so good  its get hanged if more than 3 applications are active at a time  internal memory is so less  200 mb  that even if you install few applications it gets full supports external installation but even then you fall out of memory  camera    camera  what a joke  you wont find a worser competition  lolz  software quality    most low quality devices like these pretend that they run android os but they dont  shocked  actually these are spreadtrum phones that run a chinese modification of android os they are highly unstable  will crash often most applications dont run on these os these are the toughest phones to root  please dont spend your hard earned money on such stupid gadgets

9179	Karbonn Opium N9 (Black)	worst camera phone never think to buy if you fashioned about camera  it claims that it is a 8mp camera but provides not great than 5mp also dont have needy camera settings except for camera performance is quite good it has qualcomm snapdragon 12 ghz quad core processor on board which is smoother in operation and 9mm slim stylish design with light weight of 125gms provides onehanded easy use  my suggestion for karbonn is that it should atleast claim camera as 5mp and not 8mp provide kitkat upgrade for this so still can make the performance of device smoother with qualcomm snapdragon chipset reduce the price for below rs5000 so that needy can buy the device without any hesitation  i recommend go for karbonn titanium s20 instead of this device  click this review helpful so that all can found this review and also seller and karbonn can findout what fault of this phone and can develop for next

9207	Gionee Elife E3 (Blue)	device build quality is nice however there are many problems with this device 1 camera quality is very bad i was using galaxy s duos  which has 5mp camera even that phone captures good photos compare to my elife e3 2 video quality very bad microphone is not catching sounds from even 3ft distance properly due to which volume of recorded video is very law also format is 3gp which is again a drawback 3 there is option to store apps to internal storage or removeable sd card however if i select internal storage as installation then it would store apps to system memory which is only 17gb for apps i dont have option to store apps on remaining 10gb of phone storage 4 battery life is not good i played subway surfers for 10 mins and it drained out 15 of the battery capacity  i would not recommend this phone its not up to the mark seems like over hyped phone
9208	Gionee Elife E3 (Blue)	i am using this phone since nov2013 purchased from a shop at native hadnt face any problem so far if the battery charge goes less than 50 then charging using pcs usb port doesnt help phone behaves weirdly am using original charger at work place and sony usb charger at native both modes are fine  am using this phone mostly for browsing not heavy whatsapp and facebook i have tested its performance by making it a hotspot and accessed my netbook via it worked well  overall a good phone  update after one year usage reduced the star rating from 4 to 1 1 i and my cousine had bought this phone black in two months time gap 2 both had problems in two months time gap almost after around 8 months usage ended up with change of circuit board suggested by service centre i believe this model must have a fundamental flaw 3 for board we need to wait for a minimum of one week as it has to be shipped from delhi  in my view most of the android phones have hardly one year life after that it starts giving problems i am not sure about the branded phones like samsung lg etc but these kind of chinese products really sucks no dependability on these devices  if branded phones give better life as their hardware build quality might vary though all are using android operating system it would always be better to go for them though certain features and facilities which are not covered by them service support and availability of spares would be better in branded phones is what i guess  for any new users who expect dependability must always choose widely sold brands by considering above points from my own experience at this stage i would never ever suggest this brand to anyone hereafter
9209	Gionee Elife E3 (Blue)	received the mobile yesterday night just i turned on the mobile it is started to generating more heat unable hold this mobile by hand for long duration making call with this hot condition is horrible experience  camera quality is very poor it is not at all good even in 8m pixel size  need good mobile please arrange other good mobile  regards nk sivakumar
9210	Gionee Elife E3 (Blue)	not good at rs13500 camera quality not good as compare to samsung 5 megapixel phone however it has 8mp proximity sensor and front camera stopped working after 1 month only battery life is ok on call sound is low  i suggest not to go for it
9211	Gionee Elife E3 (Blue)	so good i have buyed gioneep4 upgraded with kitkat process is good than samsung

9215	Karbonn Opium N7 (Black)	this detailed review is after 22 days of usage the phone is prone to scratches whatsapp and many apps crashed without any reasons i have 08 gb free in internal and 6gb free in external sd and still it will say low on memory when i open the camera earpiece has stopped working after 15 days was really pissed with thati dont know whether what i received was a bad product or not but i have decided i wont be buying any local brand from now on  i have approached amazon for this issue they have responded well to tackle this problem a pickup has been scheduled for today
9216	Karbonn Opium N7 (Black)	this mobile phone not 8 megapixale camera only 5 magapixale  front vga mai ullu ban gaya
9217	Karbonn Titanium S1 (Black)	it has got all the good features except that many a time the system hangs  and that is quite irritating specifically when you have to call back also it has a problem of operating as if on auto modeit is hardly one month since i started using it
9218	Karbonn Titanium S1 (Black)	it is a good phone at a reasonable price the plus points are its 1gb ram which makes it fast to load the grip is comfortable and the screen is pleasant to view the only negative point is that there are too many pre installed applications which i personally do not require but am afraid to uninstall all in all the phone is good
9219	Karbonn Titanium S1 (Black)	titanium s1 is a good quadcore budget phonebut it has some differences from the other popular quadcore devices out there  the s1 is powered by quad core msm8625 qualcomm snapdragon processor and the gpu is adreno 203 the mediatek quadcore you see in other budget phones performs better than the one inside s1 so if a lot of apps are opened in the backgroundyou may find a little bit of lagging when switching or opening apps sometimes  operating system on board is android jellybean 41 which is old but still performs well thanks to project butter  screen quality is good with a 245ppi and decent viewing angles  1 gb ram is great for the pricethis phone clearly under performs when playing high end graphics intense games thoughbut you can play many popular games like temple runfruit ninjasubway surfers etc without much issues  camera quality is average as you can expect from a device of this price range 720p video shot with this is below par  quadrant benchmark 4500 antutu benchmark 10800  battery inside is a 1600mah you can only get 1 day of average use with this  overall a good budget device if you can spend a few more bucks you can get better 1 gb ram devices under 10k though
9220	Karbonn Titanium S1 (Black)	really this phone is value for money i got it for 6700 with 10 cash back on citibank credit card i am using this phone with full fledged for gaming browsing i have not felt any problem while playing browsing not hanged not even single time also battery i am getting for more than 1 day thats fine  touch sensitive is very good and fast thanks to 1gb ram  only one negative point is camera it is not so good but still ok looks like 3 mp camera  overall thanks to karbonn
9221	Karbonn Titanium S1 (Black)	the phone automatically keeps on restarting automatically  even at the slightest of drop  just 1 cm  it restarts   i have tried to contact karbonns customer care on their website but have not received any response at all to make the matters even worse  when i tried to contact their service centres  mentioned on karbonns website over phone  all the phones were switched off  i had bought the phone considering the excellent hardware specs  which i thought were good value for money but what is the use of a phone which is unstable and keeps  on restarting dont ever buy phones from karbonn
9222	Karbonn Titanium S1 (Black)	nice look and a smart phone in budget good processor but battery not support hole day if u r surfinggaming more then 23 hour
9223	Karbonn Titanium S1 (Black)	this is my first online purchase  its from amazon about the phone not for people who can waste excess money for the same usage advantage 1price on offer bought for rs719910 2ram 1gb 3processer12 gh quadcore 4android 41 5 display 6internal storage 14gb for apps  internal 7quality cameramain striking difference disadv 1battery needed to be a bit higher on mah rating 2dialaer doest have the video calling function 3automatic settings for internet not availabeu need to set it on manual my review its an indian iphone with a caption quality products can be affordable
9224	Gionee Gpad G3 (Black)	pros good battery life large display upgradeable os has jelly bean installed already packaged with flip cover and scratch guard good quality of headphone call and speaker quality is good  cons 512 mb ram is too less most of the time it will show out of memory message especially with the kind of preinstalled apps screen resolution is not good poor quality frontcamera 5534 can be bulky for some video display is not at all good
9225	Gionee Gpad G3 (Black)	best class in class n range good batterygood big screen better than samsungbecause it never gets hang
9226	Gionee Gpad G3 (Black)	it is ok for now and i can give it 5 starts if it works fine for atleast five years without giving trouble
9227	Karbonn A93 (Black)	one of the best mobile in this range can play full hd video sound is awesome never hangs camera quality is fine but i loved this mobile better than any phone in the range of 10000

9238	OPPO R1 R829T (Black)	whos gonna even consider it a mediatek processor average ram lowend battery seeing the price why not go for oneplus one or micromax vu pay price for being slim
9239	OPPO R1 R829T (Black)	please tell us the price is a joke considering the current avaialbility in india like moto g moto e and mi
9240	OPPO R1 R829T (Black)	give it a discount of rs10k hopefully people will start looking at it as an option
9241	OPPO R1 R829T (Black)	go for oneplus for sure
9242	Micromax Canvas Music A88 (Black)	i bout this phone after reading the review and doing a lot of research   i am happy that this phone has all the feature that any other phone will have however costing more the only thing that i am really unhappy of is the battery i have to charge the phone at least 4 times a day is this how it works if so then i am really unhappy about the fact that i need to fetch for a better phone
9243	Micromax Canvas Music A88 (Black)	have used the phone for quite sometime it has heating issues while charging or using phone for a long time
9244	Micromax Canvas Music A88 (Black)	processing speed will be very very slowit is good only for 68 months aftr tatits waste of usebetter look for good processing speed mobiles and more than 1gb rami bought it a year agonow so much problemsslow and some hardware problems as well
9245	Micromax Canvas Music A88 (Black)	its worst mobile  micromax service station in hubli raghavendra service station worst   missguided me mobile screen loss it  he ask me u take mobile give to children its not work 
9246	Micromax Canvas Music A88 (Black)	go for some other phone like x2 it doesnt have internal mem od 4gb its only 500 mb approx to be used which is very low
9247	Micromax Canvas Music A88 (Black)	it is a low budget cell with high configuration the jbl headphone which came with it has really awesome results
9248	Gionee Elife E6 (White)	i got this mobile three weeks back with lots of hesitationbut boldly i made a decision to buy this mobile bcoz none of the mobile shops in chennai have this mobilebut it brake all my hesitation by the massive performancemy friends all are having samsung galaxy seriesand they told like samsung 8 mp camera is equal to the 13 mp of gionee but when i got these elife e6 their myth is brokened simply    i am very very happy by the product i got awesome lovely wondeful mobileworth for moneysurely it is an competitor to samsung s series and note series   
9249	Gionee Elife E6 (White)	i liked this phone because we get very good specs within this price 13 mp camera 2 gb ram 32 gb inbuilt memory  i have a white gionee phone the case is also white it gets dirty very soon
9250	Gionee Elife E6 (White)	a fantastic phone which i bought online as it was not available freely in local storea buying a phone without getting to see how it looks is a challenge but i was confident about the superior tech spec of the e6 though o seriously feel that the looks should be enhanced by adding metal across its rim processor is super fast i just hope that i prove the local shopowners wrong that there r no service centre s for this fone and moreso it is a chinese brand i would highly recommend this fone to all samsung buyers as this piece beats any model of samsung hands down cheers harsh
9251	Gionee Elife E6 (White)	the build quality of this device is awesome it doesnt look like a cheap chinese phone at all  on the software sidethis ships with a custom ui on top android jellybean 42 this custom ui is heavy compared to the stock ui you see on many other devices which makes it more resource hungry the ui is largely inspired by apple iphoneone other thing to talk about is the camera13mp rear camera performs quite well outdoorsbut gets noisy when light drops 5mp camera front cam is good enough for video calling  the processorgpu combination is the same as the one you see in other 1080p devices like micromax turboxolo q3000 etc  one of the common mistakes widely seen in indian market with full hd 1080p display phones is the low capacity battery gionee elife e6 too suffers from that this has a great 1080p 441ppi screenbut more pixels you cram inmore power it consumes with 2000mah batteryit would be hard to last you one whole day of average use so not recommended at all if you are heavy internet user  verdict  a very well built phone with premium looks but ships with only 2000mah battery the screen quality is top notch and everything looks great on this 1080p screen since micromax knight is outwhich ships with an octa core processorand is priced the same as thisi would recommend going for that instead if you want a device with a huge battery and 1080p displaythen xolo q3000 is the right device to get as it ships with a 4000mah battery micromax turbo is another device to considercomes cheaper than thiswith almost the same internals
9252	Gionee Elife E6 (White)	battery fit for average users will last a day timethts the only little negative aprtbut much beetr thn 2000mah batteries of other companies al the rest is up to the roofvalue for money is above 90 
9253	Gionee Elife E6 (White)	the phone is great value for money excellent build quality display and the general look and feel is premium the only downside i felt was that the gps signal is affected when its in your pocket so apps like endomondo do not work all the time
9254	Gionee Elife E6 (White)	its really a pretty good attractive phone having new cool ui 18000rs is the best price i can give for this phone dont hesitate to buy this phone if you really want to
9255	Gionee Elife E6 (White)	a fantastic mobile batter good luck
9256	Gionee Elife E6 (White)	good stuff
9257	iball Andi 4.5D Royale (1GB) Smart Phone	very bad product from iball it looks good but its filled with all junk 1 camera is okay if lighting is good but front facing camera is pathetic some time its showing green lines 2 sound is okay 3 touch is not responding well 4 ram management is okky  not showing any   lag i even tried asphalt 8 5 finally about battery i dont know how to  discribe verry horrible a fully charged battery lasting only less than 3 hrs
9258	iball Andi 4.5D Royale (1GB) Smart Phone	good
9259	Karbonn Kochadaiiyaan The Legend A6 Plus	if you use phone for calling only by all means this is the best phone lowest internal memory104mb which leads it nto situaions where error messages pop up for low memory like when using gallery and camera apps not great display cheap paint on home buttons heavy in weight when you use earphones the mic becomes inactive you got to use a earphne with mic option here not a great battery itll go off before evening very slow really cream of worst phones
9260	Karbonn Kochadaiiyaan The Legend A6 Plus	good look nice ph as compare to prise and screen touch is nice but internal memory is low affordable price
9261	Xolo Play T1000 (Black)	i bought this phone from mirchimart amazon they delivered it to me within no time good enough used it and found that the camera is not working mirchimart acted prudently and replaced in 3days  but the replacement has a new problem this phone really sucks it was defective again i cant speak to anyone at all callers voice starts breakingshakingcracking or watever you may call itanalogous to the sound of virus hacking in transformers part i i am so excited about this phone when i ordered it and i am so much disappointed now i must say that please dont buy this phone or dont buy any phone from xolo xolo sucks with their products and services they respond to customer emails after a span of 34days atleast
9262	Xolo Play T1000 (Black)	as on 26 dec 2013  short  bad product  issues calls drop in 95 of calls when in pocket screen gets easily unlocked and makes calls battery quickly drops from 60 to 20  good for gaming is good camera is good  have stopped using it as a phone  using only for camera games  as on 12 november 2013 used for more than 2 months  pros  the make is professional compared to many other chinese products i have seen before video play is smooth 1080p video record is stable gaming is smooth screen protector is bundled packaging is very elegant  in full black  cons  stereo socket has design defect  you can hear only if you remove the back cover battery charing pin gets easily displaced netwrok reception is unstable gps takes time to lock battery barely lasts a day speaker is low
9263	Xolo Play T1000 (Black)	phones worth half of its price out perform this by  a mile a rebranded chinese phone called beidou little pepper its full of bugs xolo has abandoned this phone with regards to updates it did not receive any major updates people in the xolo play facebook group are desperately trying to sell it off its a surprise that this phone is still listed
9264	Xolo Play T1000 (Black)	well using this phone from about last 2weeks will like to tell you some thing  if you want to buy a phone with superb looks thats right superb looks in fact i will rate the looks above the samsung phones and sony phones with in the same price range in fact looks are above any samsung phone rubberized finish will definitely impress everyone and it makes handling much easier and phone does not slip away from handas in case of plastic finish at the back in samsung and sony phone  touch is very very responsive and resolution on this screen size gives you a awesome display colors are quite sharp and attractive  performance with 1gb ram and 15 ghz quadcore processor is good 4gb internal also works well but i feels it as a  a little less as it is supposed to be a gaming phone and almost every game takes a good memory well phone also gives you option of moving apps if u have any class 100 memory card then its awesome  battery is a bit issue for me was not lasting  for one whole day in the beginning as their was quite installing gaming surfing very frequently for whole day but now it hardly last for one day with moderate use  if battery life can b increased by xolo then its awesome phone other criticle issue is regarding low volume whenever you make a call it is quite difficult to hear other person that is speaker volume is quite less if you are traveling or are at noisy place then this can be a big headache  rating out of 10 looks9 touch9 performance855 deducted due to bit slower performance when app on card display9 battery70 speaker volumecall 6
9265	Xolo Play T1000 (Black)	for mid range and looking for gaming features thus phone is very good xolo is working really hard and i think its much better then micromax and other phone built quality is very good
9266	Xolo Play T1000 (Black)	the phone works very fast and quick but losses battery very quick too rest it can beat any good branded android phone in the market good features
9267	Xolo Play T1000 (Black)	xolo t1000 is just one of the best mobile phone you can get in price range compared to other expensive mobiles

9274	Samsung Galaxy Young GT-S6312 (Metallic Silver)	i really like this model it fits in the hand better than any model easy to use fast enough for all the games
9275	Samsung Galaxy Young GT-S6312 (Metallic Silver)	very good mobile and all fetures is good 
9276	Samsung Galaxy Young GT-S6312 (Metallic Silver)	super mobiel
9277	Galaxy S4 Zoom SM-C101 (Black)	i have been using this phone for about a month its not heavy or bulky so much that you would notice it is not much bigger than the old lg viewty that i used to have and loved i even bought the capdase jacket which makes it even thicker but i feel evens up the lens side  it has a decent optical zoom and better than carrying a compact camera and a phone or simply trying to take pictures with a standard phone it has a tripod mount and i am just waiting for a mount to arrive for the handlebars of my motorcycle so that i can take travel movies  other negatives cited include only the 8gb internal memory well its not unusual to need to buy external memeory i upgraded to a 64gb card and put 20gb of music on still leaving around 40gb for apps and photos i have a pro slr camera with two 16gb cards which is sufficient for my photographic needs 40gb then exceeds that especially when the picture size is fairly small at 16mp jpg rather than capturing raw  battery life is excellent it lasts me around one day without a charge better than the htc i have that lasts only 810 hours the battery and sim are easily accessible from a flip up door so this could be a second phone that you take with you on days out perhaps  my only gripes are that the picture size could be bigger only 16mp and tethering reverse tethering is complicated having to root the phone to do the latter there are only two usb options on the galaxy menu camera or media devicei also dont like the fact that its not possible to initiate movies from the shutter button although this does allow stills to be captured during filming i would like to attach the camera to the strap of my backpack which would make the reverse of the phone inaccessible  if you travel a bit and like taking photos this could be the phone for you  feb 2014  i am down grading review from 4 to 3 issues that i have found  1the lens has a glass outer in front of the auto lens cap this tends to gets smudged and potentially scratched making the camera useless or would need an expensive repair  2i have found that tiny specs of dustlint have started to accumulate in front of the lens behind the glass i just need one in the middle of the lens and the camera will not be useable
9278	Galaxy S4 Zoom SM-C101 (Black)	this mobile is fabulous its camera quality is amazing
9279	Galaxy S4 Zoom SM-C101 (Black)	it is useful and intelligent  product but battery too small does not last full day even otherwise very good could become slimmer like nokia lumia 1040
9280	Galaxy S4 Zoom SM-C101 (Black)	a point and shoot camera with a phone insidethis is samsung galaxy s4 zoom dont get confused this with the galaxy camera which is just a camera running on android  this thing is bulky looks and behaves like a camerathe front of the device looks like any other samsung android device it has a 43inch super amoled touchscreen resolution  960x540 256 ppi with gorilla glass 3 for protection  s4 zoom is powered by a 15ghz dualcore exynos 4212 cpu together with 15gb of ram  more than enough for your day to day photographic activities with this device  pros 1 10x optical zoom 2 sensor size  1233inch sensorwhich is the same size you get in many point and shoot cameras 3 64 gb sdcard support 4 impressive image quality for a smartphonebut not the best 5 good macro capabilities 6 powerful xenon flash 7 image stabilization  works well during video shooting 8 many camera shooting modes included in the camera app 9 good call quality 10 a lot of creative camera apps in playstore  cons 1 the display is qhdsince this is a photography centric device they should have accommodated at least a 720p screen to see the images on the screen in better quality and detail 2 battery life is not that great 3 night time shots are not that impressive 4 zoom ring is not smoothwhich means trying zooming in while shooting video causes video shakesone other notable problem is thatin recorded videos you can hear the zoomin zoomout motor sounds there are also onscreen zoom controls 5 no raw shooting support  who is this camera for at this price you can get better point and shoot cameras giving far better image quality than s4 zoom so if you take photos only during some special occasions say a weddinga party etcthis is not what you should be buying this is for people who love to have one single devicesame device to connect to internetmake calls and shoot decent pictures with good zoom capabilitiesthis can be the perfect device for those who loves to click and upload them to facebookinstagram etc on the move  make sure to check image quality of this camera before buying though
9281	Galaxy S4 Zoom SM-C101 (Black)	product is fine  but delivery was so late and pathetic spoiled my festive mood  order came after the days of estimated time amazon promised me to deliver product on particular day but didnt turn up instead got arguments and excuses its a serious issue  am sorry for writing it up  but kindly learn customer satisfaction ethics  one more disgusting thing which amazon showed to me   tried bribing me with a amazon gift card kindly understand  that the problem which i faced due to above issue is unacceptable  spoiled my festive time  faced same issue twice  thanks a lot guys you have lost one customer  gudbye amazon
9282	Galaxy S4 Zoom SM-C101 (Black)	phone is very bulky in comparision to what it looks like in picture very difficult to carry it in pocket i requested amazon to return it but they refused to either return or exchange it was a bad decision to purchase this phone just on the basis of photograph

9310	iBall Andi 5T Cobalt 2 (Black)	a copy of my email to iball poor product poorer customer service i needed to buy a phone in july  3 months ago i went to a local store he recommended this it looked nice i bought it i figured that it didnt work i could not scroll watsapp i could not use playlists videos froze the screen all brands of memory cards were not supported this fact is verified by the store guy by using different brands of cards i returned it unfortunately the store could only replace it and not give me another brand in exchange the new phone also had issues i figured i could not do much and made peace with it in exactly three months the phone got switched of every time i disconnected it from the charger it reached a point when it did not even switch on with the charger  when i examined the battery it had inflated from both sides i was scared it might explode if i charged it anymore i called the closest service centre on a wednesday they said i could only come before two8203 i wonder why since its official timings are till 630 i guess everyone gets lazy the next day no one answered any of the numbers finally on the third day they asked me to come and they would replace the battery i went to this small dingy box in a dingy lane which didnt have space for more than 10 people at a time most people resent there had complaints regarding the battery 8203they asked me to submit the phone i argued that just the battery needs to be replaced they said ok submit the battery and come after a week i could see atleast 200 batteries in a transparent box staring at me i asked them to replace right away they refused i requested for a battery replacement they refused i begged that i was travelling in 4 days to replace by then they refused so i came back to flipkart to buy a new phone iball
